"JERRY","You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about ""We should go out""? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. (imitates one of these people ""tryin' to find us""; pretends his hand is a phone) ""Did you ring?, I can't find him."" (imitates other person on phone) ""Where did he go?"" (the first person again) ""He didn't tell me where he was going"". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: ""We gotta be getting back"". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George's shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Are you through? (kind of irritated)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","You do of course try on, when you buy?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh, you don't recall?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(pretends he's talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"WAITRESS","Mister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"WAITRESS","It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. (ironically)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"WAITRESS","Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","No, you didn't!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There's no milk in here, what...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Wait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Oh, nothing happened, but it was...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","This is great!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had to come in""?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, but...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","To be polite? You are insane!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yes!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh, I get it, this is about the button.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"CLAIRE","What gave it away, George?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent ""has to"") come to New York on business...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh you are beautiful! (ironically)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","and, and maybe (again some gestures) she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"CLAIRE","I'd have to say: uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(to Claire) So why did she call?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"CLAIRE","To be polite.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","To be polite, I rest my case.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Come on, I'm tired.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"CLAIRE","(to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","And you didn't even hear how she sounded.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","What?!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Laura.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I can't believe: (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, but how could you be so sure?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(gets up) 'Cause it's signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","No.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","What is that? It's ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Maybe you're right.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","You're gonna ""overdry"" it.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","You, you can't ""overdry"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Why not?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Same as you can't ""overwet"". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't ""overdie"", you can't ""overdry"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","How could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(points to the dryer) Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","""Laundry-day"" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: ""C'mon babe, let's gather"". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: (sock's voice) ""Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!"" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(The phone rings. He picks it up and says:) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(enters) Are you up?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't understand the name; maybe ""Kramer"" wasn't named ""Kramer"" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(a little irritated) Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a ""what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look"" and Kramer asks:) Are you done with this?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","No.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you're done, let me know.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","You want me to talk to her?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","I don't think so.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","That close, huh?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","You better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Give me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV)...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","A SLIDE!...Wow!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer:) I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(hands George a beer) Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","A decent hotel-room...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","(ironically) Well, that's flattering.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Why even give her an option?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","This is a person I like, it's not: ""How to score on spring break"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","So what? That's good.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Now, how could that be good?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: ""I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","This is how you operate?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Yeah, I wish.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Let me just wipe the sink.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It's unbelievable.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","...How's the real estate-business?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","...(surprised he asked) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Well, I might be getting in to that.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"KRAMER","(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I'm aware of you, all right, let's go (opens the bathroom door), let's go! (Jerry and the dog come out) You're on stage in 25 minutes.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: ""I could use a cotton-ball right now""...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: ""Let's move on""... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: ""Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Really? How?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","'Cause it's all in the greeting.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Uh-huh.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Right.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is good.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","""Lip-area"".","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Ya know a hug: definitely good.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Hug is definitely good.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Sure.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","That's so brutal, I hate that.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Ya know how they do that?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Hand-sandwich.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Right.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...(suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Guess who?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Hey, hey.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA AND JERRY","Heeeey! (they take each others hands like they're planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","It's good to see you.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Hi.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","This is my friend George.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","(shakes George's hand) Hi, how nice to meet you.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Hi, how are you?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","This is Laura.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Laura, sure.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(to Laura) I can't believe you're here.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE AND JERRY","Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. (they pick up the bags)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Oh, thank you.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(privately to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"GEORGE","Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","So uh, what do ya think?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","(laughs) Actually uhm, do you have any wine?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? (points to the lamp)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. (she turns down the lamp)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Really? What would you like to do?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","(doubtfully) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pours the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. (the phone rings; he picks it up) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Uhm, it's for you.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","(she takes the phone) Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye (she hangs up the phone). Never get engaged.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","You're engaged?","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","You're engaged? (still can't believe it)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of ""we"", uh, it's a very stressful situation.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","You're engaged! (like he's answering his own question)","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Yeah.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"LAURA","You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","Me too!","good-news,-bad-news",1
"JERRY","I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: (imitates horn).","good-news,-bad-news",1
"THE END"," THE END","good-news,-bad-news",1

"ELAINE","""Coccoon II: The Return"". I guess they didn't like it up there...","the-stakeout",2

"ELAINE","Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen *everything*.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Oh, lovely...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yeah...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","What do you think their parents think?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","""So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?""","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Pamela? Do I know her?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Yeah, you met her when we were going out.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh yeah, right...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(quickly) No.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Blonde hair remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you *totally* blocked","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Riverside Drive.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Right! In fact... No, never mind...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Well, what is it?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","What little deal?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Y'know, my parents are coming in for this...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","They're coming in?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yeah, tomorrow.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Why does he do that?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Doesn't think anyone can tell?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","So c'mon, do we have a deal?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","A *wedding*?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","There's a lot of people to mock...","the-stakeout",2

"JERRY","Was I supposed to bring something?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","You could have.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I met her *one* time...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","It is not necessary.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What did you say then?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Sssshhhhhh!!!","the-stakeout",2

"JERRY","I'm in for five...","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","I'll supply the hat.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself) Uh-oh... What do we have here...","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly.","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","How masculine...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos.","the-stakeout",2
"ROGER","(To Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker...","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Oh, you know Bricker! From where?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself) What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's","the-stakeout",2

"JERRY","Friend of a friend. And you?","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","We went to law school together.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Oh, Jerry!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself) Oh no, not *now*...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","I had this dream last night and you were in it.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh really... (To himself) Oh God, I gotta get out of this...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","You were you, but, you weren't you...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No kidding... (To himself) Why is this happening? Please, make","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself) This is *brutal*...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","How do you like that... (To himself) Can I turn now? Is this","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Jerry? Are you listening to me?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yes, I *heard* you.","the-stakeout",2
"PAMELA","Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself) Thank *you*, Pamela!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To Vanessa) So, you're a lawyer...","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","(To himself, quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Oh, that was you!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Imagine, spelling ""Mom"" with two O's...","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Very funny! What do you do?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Comedian.","the-stakeout",2
"VANESSA","Really... That explains it...","the-stakeout",2

"JERRY","(To himself, *very* quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","That wasn't so bad, really...","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Why? What did I do?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Well, I just don't appreciate these little ""courtesy responses"",","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I was listening!","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... ""conversation"".","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","Uh-huh...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! *I*","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?","the-stakeout",2
"ELAINE","So nothing... Nothing...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Hey!","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Ah, there he is!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Ma, will you stop?","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","No, why should we take over your apartment?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, he's making a bouillabaisse.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Depends on the firm.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","What's the matter? You need a lawyer?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Why not?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","He used to go with her...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Which one is she?","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh yeah, she's great.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","So, how come nothing materialized there?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","I know what it was...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","You don't know what it was...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","So, what was it?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Well, we fight a lot for some reason...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh, she is, she absolutely is.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","I can see if there was a *weight* problem...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I know, I know...","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Idiot... (To Jerry) So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","That's got *nothin'* to do with it.","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","How about Loni Anderson?","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Where do you get Loni Anderson?","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't ""the one"".","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","And this other one's ""the one""?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I dunno, maybe...","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","So ask Elaine there for the number.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her,","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","How could you still see her if your not interested?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","We're *friends*.","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Oh yeah...","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Well, go up to the office.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Up to her office?","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I guess...","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","You mean ""stakeout"" the lobby?","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","So you've got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! What","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","He pretends he *bumped* into her!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","What does she look like?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I dunno. Hard to say.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","What actress does she remind you of?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Loni Anderson.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Loni Anderson?!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I'm a little nervous.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Yeah, me too...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","You came to see me; I work in the building.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What do you do?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","I'm an *architect*.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","You're an *architect*?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","I'm not?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I don't see architecture comin from you...","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","I suppose *you* could be an architect...","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which is remote.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What is *his* name?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr.....","the-stakeout",2

"GEORGE","Yeah, right.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Well, what does *he* do?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","He's an importer.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Just imports, no exports?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","He's an importerexporter, okay?","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Say, did Elaine ever call you back?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","No, I guess she's still mad.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Never.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Wait a second... That's her... on the right.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","I forgot who I am! Who am I?!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.","the-stakeout",2
"GEORGE","Vandelay!","the-stakeout",2

"VANESSA","Really. What do you design?","the-stakeout",2

"JERRY","She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","She knows what?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a ""Z""...","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","So, how did she find out?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told","the-stakeout",2
"MORTY","So, what are you? Afraid of her?","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","What else did she say on the phone?","the-stakeout",2
"HELEN","Whatever I wrote down.","the-stakeout",2

"MAC","Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography.","the-stakeout",2
"JERRY","Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...","the-stakeout",2
"MAC","It's based on all my experiences!","the-stakeout",2

"GEORGE","If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Yes, I am.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","(looks at a carrying pouch George is wearing) You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?","male-unbonding",4

"GEORGE","I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him ""I Don't think we're right for each other.."" He's a guy. At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,","male-unbonding",4

"JERRY","Just break up with him?","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.","male-unbonding",4

"JERRY","Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't mean it.","male-unbonding",4
"JOEL","Didn't mean what?","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.","male-unbonding",4
"JOEL","Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends.","male-unbonding",4

"GEORGE","So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's ""not working"".","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Really.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Hm? You ate.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Someone says, ""Get out of my life!"" and that doesn't affect your appetite?","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Have you ever had their egg salad?","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","It is unbelievable.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off","male-unbonding",4

"JERRY","(talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Why did you give him my ticket for?","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","You didn't see him. It was horrible.","male-unbonding",4
"GOERGE","Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","I had to do it.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?","male-unbonding",4

"GEORGE","Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","(pantomimes sticking an imaginary knife in his heart, and twists it) Oh geeeee.. Go, go!","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","I.. no, I don't want to go.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","He was really crying?","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we could go?","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","George, the man wept.","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you. This pizza idea, is really going to happen.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air; and then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese,","male-unbonding",4
"GOERGE","You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","It's all supervised.","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","Oh, well.","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","All of it. You want to invest?","male-unbonding",4
"GEORGE","My money's all tied up in change right now.","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","No, I'm tellin' ya, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","That's you.","male-unbonding",4

"JERRY","I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?","male-unbonding",4
"ELAINE","(gives Jerry the list) Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","What can I do?","male-unbonding",4
"ELAINE","Deal with it. Be a man!","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying, tears accompanied by mucus.","male-unbonding",4
"ELAINE","You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I got the cab.","male-unbonding",4
"JERRY","A couple of touch monkeys.","male-unbonding",4
"KRAMER","Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!","male-unbonding",4

"VANESSA","Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","(Starting to like the idea) Really? Could we go fishing up there?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","They have marlin in Vermont?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Oh, big fighting marlin.","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Is that my paper?","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Bad news, my friend.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What? What news?","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Sendrax.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Two and a half points.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper) That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Hey, I told ya.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza, please.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(Into phone) George, what's going on?!","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Sell it, just say I'm selling!","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Okay.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","You're gone alright.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","(Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map.. what..","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What friends?","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look) 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So you don't know what's wrong with him?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Well, this is it. I'm selling.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Just give it a little more time.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I""m not cut out for investing.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Where?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","To the hospital.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","The hospital?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (knocking on glass) ""How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (makes hissing sound) By the","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Maybe he's resting.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Who goes to the hospital to rest?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","What are you, a doctor?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Alright.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","(To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","May I help you?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","When did you bring it in?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","You got a receipt?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I can't find the receipt.","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","You should get the receipt.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! In fact, forget the money. I don't even","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","Maybe you asked for it to be washed?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","No.. dry-cleaned.","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing..","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!","the-stock-tip",5
"DRY CLEANER","I shrunk it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, ""Well, it's ruined."" And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, ""It's not","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Bless you.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So what are you gonna do?","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I'm no cat killer.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","How about we go over there right now and we shave them?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","He actually wen to the hospital?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Oh man, he's nuts.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper) I know, I know. It's down again.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","How much are you down altogether?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Wow.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","You don't have to say ""Wow."" I know it's ""Wow."" And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","It's George. (Presses button to let George in.)","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I really don't need to look.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.","the-stock-tip",5
"KRAMER","I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head ""no"".) How long were you there?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Fifteen seconds.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","You told him you knew Simons?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Didn't work, huh?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","(Laughs) Not quite.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now.","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","I know. You mentioned it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Oh yeah, right. (To himself) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","No, it's got a little battery.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Well, that's good. (To himself) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. (To Vanessa)","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","No, it's okay.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold - charming?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","Not especially.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","What can we do? It's raining.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","We cold play ""Sorry!"" We cold play ""Steal the Old Man's Bundle."" (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","Oh, you've never heard of it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","No, what? What kind is it?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","I can't tell you.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby) Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","That stock? I thought you got out of that?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","I told you not to sell.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","You did not tell me not to sell.","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","That's probably why.. (stops herself)","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","What?","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","Forget it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","No, what? 'That's probably why..'","the-stock-tip",5
"VANESSA","That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that purfume..","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I'm good, thanks.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","I'm kinda full.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","So don't finish it.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","(acidly) She's full. (George puts up his hands in an ""excuse me"" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little trasaction","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","I don't like to discuss figures.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","How much?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","Is taht still from the cats?","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","No, I just have a cold.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","So, what ever happened with that?","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs)","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","He chose the cats?","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","They're very clean animals.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time.","the-stock-tip",5
"ELAINE","Superman can go back in time?","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","We went over that.","the-stock-tip",5
"GEORGE","Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of robot butcher.","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","A robot butcher?","the-stock-tip",5
"GOERGE","Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. (Calling to waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress tears of check, George stops her) No, no, no. That'","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You","the-stock-tip",5
"THE END"," THE END","the-stock-tip",5
"JERRY","I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, ""Is this the best lane for","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","She can't kill me right?!","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, of course not.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","People break up all the time.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Everyday.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You tried.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I kept looking at her face. I'd go: ""C'mon, love her. Love her!""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Did you tell her you loved her?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go ""Oh, really?"" or ""Boy, that's, that's","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You're a human being.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You're too nice a guy.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You're flesh and blood.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I told you when I met her..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","My back is killing me.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Hi.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Hey, what are you doing?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I'm letting you in.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No, you won't.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Okay..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Why can't you sit in the middle?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Is it that obvious?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Hello, Jerry.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Hello.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Did you get a haircut?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, shower. So, where are we eating?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","(imitating Tony Bennett) ""You know, I'd go from nods to nothing..""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Really?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","You would do that?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","If I was a different person.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Come on up.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","(Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Taste this.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, I just had a sandwich.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","No, taste it. Taste it.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I don't want cantaloupe now.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","You've never had cantaloupe like this before.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Alright.. (tastes it)","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Ah, huh. It's good?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It's very good.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Good, huh?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Good.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","I got it at Joe's.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Uh-Huh.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It's too far.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You did it? What happened?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen.""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Ah ha.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I said, ""Listen Marlene,"" and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: ""You're doing it! You're doing","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","See, it's never as bad as you imagine.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","I liked Marlene. What's her number?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No, I, I don't think so.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Could you stop that smacking?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Oh no, thank you.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No, really. No, no, thanks.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's it? You're out?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So, go get them.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So forget about the books. Did you read them?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Well, yeah.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","What do you need them for?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I don't know. They're books.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","They're MY books.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So you want me to get those books? Is that it?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So what'd you do?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","(Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","(Irritated) I don't know how this happened.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Jerry, it's not my fault.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, ""Hello, Jerry?"" and I'll go ""Oh, hi Marlene."" And then it's ""Jerry..""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","What about getting off the phone?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, ""Alright, then.. "" You know, it just goes on and on and on with","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Yeah. Yes, she is.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"RECEPTIONIST","Mr. Costanza?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"RECEPTIONIST","The doctor'll see you now.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","(To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword puzzle) I better take this. I","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"I"," I","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says ""Waiting room."" There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So, how was it?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Well, it's a first visit.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You can't do that.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Are you feeling weird?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, I'm fine.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Nothing really happened.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Yeah, I know.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","We just kissed a little. People kiss.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Well.. night.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Good night.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Hey.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","I got it! This time, I got it!","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Alright.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Hips! See, it's all hips.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Uh-huh.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","That is out there.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Joe's?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, supermarket.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Well, is it good?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It's okay.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I'm not taking it back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I don't care about it.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Alright. Take it back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","(On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","(Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Well?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Marlene","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","(Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","I thought you were trying to get rid of her?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Does George know?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","No, he'd go nuts.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Yeah, no kidding.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Woah, psycho-sexual.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I don't know how I'm going to tell him.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It's partially you, yeah.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Well, he can't kill me, right?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","You're a human being.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","You're flesh and blood.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I'm a nice guy.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Oh, my little airplane lamp.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Unless you're married to a dictator..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Nope. No good.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"KRAMER","Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Yep.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You talked to him?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man.""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Right.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","""You little phony""?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."" And I said, ""Well, how do you go from that to","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Amazing.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","And he says, he says, ""Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?"" And I said, ""Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"ELAINE","This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I don't care.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You're kidding.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No, I don't care.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You mean that?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","Absolutely.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You don't care?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","How could you not care?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I thought you'd be upset.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I guess I should be but I'm not.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I know, I know.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","(Angry) You paid that crook?!","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I had to.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","It was embarrassing to me.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","I was trying to make a point.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps) What's wrong?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"GEORGE","(Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Really? I thought..","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","I know, I'm sorry.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Of course I want to talk about it.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","..I saw your act.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","My act? What does that have to do with anything?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You're a cashier!","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"MARLENE","I heard the material.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have. ""Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor."" ""I'm in development, research, consulting."" Men on the other hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, ""Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie.""","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"THE END"," THE END","the-ex-girlfriend",6
"JERRY","My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","(To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He doesn't respond) What's","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Are you getting that?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","I thought you were getting it.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Should I pick up?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","You want me to get that?","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","I'll get it!","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","I'll get it!","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Hello?.. Hello?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","So, how'd you do?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","This is your greatest moment? A game?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","But it's their 50th anniversary.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","First of all, I made plans with Elaine.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","So bring her.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","How come he gets to leave?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","And it's always about Jeffrey, right?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Morty, are you coming in?","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","(To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Yeah!","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Levels.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Levels?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You drew up plans for this?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","No, no. It's all in my head.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Oh, I'll be comfortable.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","When do you intend to do this?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You're doing this yourself?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Hey, that's some big job.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I don't see it happening.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Seriously?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I'll give you a year.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","No, no, no. End of the month.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","It's a bet. (They both ""pinkie swear"" to lock the deal)","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","No, no. I'm fine.","the-pony-remark",7
"LEO","Jerry, are you listening to this?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Yeah, Uncle Leo.","the-pony-remark",7
"LEO","So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Right. For reducing the pond scum?","the-pony-remark",7
"LEO","No, for the walking tours.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.","the-pony-remark",7
"LEO","That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Mickey Mantle?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","(Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Mmm.. phenomenal peas..","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Are you ready for dessert?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","(Surprised) You're going?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","Can't dance?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","He's kidding, Manya.","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","Is that a joke?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","(Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","Yeah, yeah..","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Horses. They're like big riding dogs.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","..I had a pony.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","(Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","You! You said so!","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..","the-pony-remark",7
"MANYA","That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I'll drive you to the airport.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","No, we're taking a cab.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","You know, you should give Manya a call.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Maybe I will.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) ..Need any help with those?","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Goodbye, Jerry.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Take care.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","We'll call you. (Leaves)","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Bye, Jer.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Bye, Dad. Take it easy.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Bye, Mr. Kramer.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","So, when do I get my dinner?","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","There's not bet if I' not doing it.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","That's the bet! That you're not doing it!","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","And it could be done.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.","the-pony-remark",7
"KRAMER","But I don't want the levels!","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. (Jerry","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Who did you talk to?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Uncle Leo.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","And when's the funeral?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I don't know. He said he'd call back.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","What?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","What? Nothing.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You don't think.. What? The pony remark?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You don't think that I killed her?","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You know what the flight back'll cost us?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday.","the-pony-remark",7

"HELEN","So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I didn't even know the woman.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","So don't go.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","Jery, no one's forcing you.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't have anything.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","I got a sport jacket.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","You're not wearing that to a funeral.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","What's wrong with it?","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","It looks ridiculous.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I don't know what to do.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Two Forty-Five.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","And what time's the funeral?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Two o' clock.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","How long does a funeral take?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","So you cna't do both?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","How can you even consider not going?","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I know, and then you say to yourself, ""From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it."" But then you go, ""How? What can I do that's not","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","He has to go. He may have killed her.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","(To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Bender.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Three hundred a month? Oh my God.","the-pony-remark",7
"MAN","Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about now.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.","the-pony-remark",7
"INTERN","I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..","the-pony-remark",7
"LEO","(Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Oh, me too.","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Although they say it's a dry heat.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.","the-pony-remark",7
"ISAAC","Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","(to Jerry) Oh, Jeffrey.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(To Elaine) You know Jeffery?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.","the-pony-remark",7
"HELEN","It's raining.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","(Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.","the-pony-remark",7
"INTERN","I can't. I'll get in trouble.","the-pony-remark",7
"MORTY","Oh, for God's sakes!","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","It's never happend to me before.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I remember saying to myself, ""Why is Jerry so far off the base?""","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I thought there were two outs.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","It was the single worst moment of my life.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","What about Sharon Besser?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Oh, well, of course. 1973.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Wonder about what?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","You know.. the spirit world.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","I never saw anyone play like that.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","But I went ot the funeral.","the-pony-remark",7
"ELAINE","Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Don't you think she would've heard I was there?","the-pony-remark",7
"GEORGE","Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs)","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why","the-pony-remark",7
"THE END"," THE END","the-pony-remark",7
"JERRY","I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I think I've seen enough.","the-jacket",8
"SALESMAN","Well, I might have something in the back.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, ""Just Back."" All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Picks","the-jacket",8
"CUSTOMER","(Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.","the-jacket",8
"CUSTOMER","Alton Benes is your father?","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-jacket",8
"CUSTOMER","I always felt he deserved a wider audience.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","What? What, you don't want to go now?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","No, I'll go. I'm going.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","(Shocked) Oh my God.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad?","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","You have no idea.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I have some idea.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","No idea.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I've got a ballpark.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","There is no park and the team has relocated.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Looks at the tag) ..That is high.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. ""What about the money?"" ""What's money?""","the-jacket",8
"SALESMAN","It looks wonderful on you.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Hey.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Hey. New jacket?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","What do you think?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","It's beautiful.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Is it me?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","That's definitely you.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Really?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","That's more you than you've ever been. (Starts looking the jacket over) What is with the pink lining?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I don't know. It's got a pink lining.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I paid what it costs.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","How much?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","What's the difference?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","What, you're not gonna tell me?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Over three hundred?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Yes, but let's just stop it right there.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","It's over four hundred?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Really, I'm not answering anymore.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Is it over four hundred?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Would you?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","(Finds the tag) Woah, Nelson!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I know, I know.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","(Talking about his old jacket) What are you gonna do with the leather one?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Well, are you gonna wear it?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Maybe.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","(Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear this.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Do you want it?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take it.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Good karma for you. (Kramer puts on his new jacket, and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","""Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to make a stir everyone appreciates a..""","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","What is that song?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","You know, Schumann went mad from that.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","No, you idiot.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Oh, Schumann. Of course.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures ""That's the breaks."" George gasps) Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","""Master of the house, keeper of the inn.."" (Jerry proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in admiration at the jacket) This is huge!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Absolutely.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","..It's fabulous.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I know.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Well, what kind of solid?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Birds?","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","So take a cab.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","They won't take a cage full of birds.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","George, do me a solid? Two minutes.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.","the-jacket",8
"KRAMER","Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","""Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by.""","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared) Where are they?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Maybe he didn't show up.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","What, you don't want to do this?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a second, is that him?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I'm nervous.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Excuse me.. Mister Benes?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Yeah?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Sit down. Want a drink?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Sure.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","(Summons waiter) What do you have?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.","the-jacket",8
"BENES","(Gives both Jerry and George a look) I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","You like ice?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Huh?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I said, do you like ice?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Like it?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Don't you think you get more without it?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","(Pauses) Where's Elaine?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I guess today she's late.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","It appears that way.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Yep.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Yep.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Looks like rain.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Who said?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","No, of course not. I didn't..","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (Waiter shows up with the drinks) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I'm just a regular person.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","No, no. He's just being modest.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing funny about that.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Drivel.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Maybe some parts.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","What parts?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and leaves)","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Thank you for leaving me alone with him!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","That was brutal. I can't go back out there.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Well, let's just leave.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Elaine'll kill me.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Where is she?","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","She's gotta be here soon.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","The waiter was trembling.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","How are we gonna get out of it?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, ""To hell with the","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Who'd you call?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","What kind of operation?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Bone marrow.","the-jacket",8
"MANAGER","Mister Benes?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Yes?","the-jacket",8
"MANAGER","A message for you. (Hands him a message)","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes. (Jerry and George freeze)","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(Adding) Well, Guatamala.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Sure, Guatamala.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","(Gets up) Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going to the bathroom. (Leaves)","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Come on, let's go!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","What about Elaine?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","To hell with Elaine!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","She'll be furious.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","We're dying here!","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","That's her! She's here!","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","(Mocking Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Where have you been?!","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Oh, you didn't..","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","(After hearing Elaine's story, his is..) Great.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Couldn't be better.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Oh, no, no.","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Get outta here..","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Man, Kramer! I could kill him.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","He said he'd give me a lift.","the-jacket",8
"JERRY","Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?","the-jacket",8
"GEORGE","Where do you come up with this stuff?","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","(Returns) Well, look who's here.","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","Oh, Hi, Dad.","the-jacket",8
"ALTON","(Kisses Elaine) Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?","the-jacket",8
"ELAINE","No one.","the-jacket",8

"DONNA","Thanks again for the movie.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","You're welcome.","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Oh, that's OK.","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Unless you want to go to your place.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Take it easy, huh, take it easy.","the-phone-message",9

"JERRY","Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Thursday's great. (Moves closer)","the-phone-message",9

"JERRY","You like that commercial?","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Yeah, it's clever.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Yeah, that's the one.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","What could you possibly like about that?","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","I don't know, I like the guys.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","(Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","(Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","But they're talking about nothing.","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","That's the point.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","I know the point.","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","No one is telling you to like it.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,","the-phone-message",9

"JERRY","No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his","the-phone-message",9
"TUB","germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","You're still thinking about this?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","(While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o clock at","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Maybe coffee was coffee.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Well some people drink coffee that late.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","All she'll think is that you like her.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","I don't know what your parents did to you.","the-phone-message",9
"KRAMER","Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","I don't think so.","the-phone-message",9
"KRAMER","It's funny.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","It is funny.","the-phone-message",9
"KRAMER","That's as good as anything you do.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Why do we have to leave?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Oh, see, this is the problem.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","You're kicking me out of my house?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Don't forget.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?","the-phone-message",9

"JERRY","What did you say?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and","the-phone-message",9
"NOW","'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","After one date you try and improvise on her machine?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Now I'm in the worst position of all.","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","He did that?","the-phone-message",9
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Somebody did that?","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","She'll call you back. You're overreacting.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Not once.","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Never?","the-phone-message",9

"GEORGE","Say? What? Nothing, I..","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","You told him how I like the commercial.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","Well, so what if I said that?","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","(To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?","the-phone-message",9
"DONNA","I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Boy oh boy.","the-phone-message",9

"GEORGE","I lost it.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","She did. Today.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","What?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","So she didn't get the messages.","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to","the-phone-message",9

"JERRY","Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","I'll meet her outside the building.","the-phone-message",9
"JERRY","But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right","the-phone-message",9
"GEORGE","Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I","the-phone-message",9

"ELAINE","She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Maybe.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something in Spanish)","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Harold and Manny.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the hall)","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Boys, boys.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Oh, Jerry.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold in Spanish) I was only","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.","the-apartment",10
"MANNY","Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","(To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Oh yeah, I like her. She always says ""hello"" to me.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's true.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","(Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.","the-apartment",10
"MANNY","(In Spanish) It looks worse.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","(Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","What was that all about?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Oh, nothing important.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","What's going on? What is that look?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What look? Nothing.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Something's going on here.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Would you please?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What would you say if I told you that..","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Told me what?!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","..I got you an apartment in this building.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","(Dumbfounded) No.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yes.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","No.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yes.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","You didn't.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I did.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","You got me an apartment in the building?!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I got you an apartment in the building.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","How did you..","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","No.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","She died.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","(Thrilled) She died?!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","She died.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","She died!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Four hundred a month.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","And I'll be right upstairs?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Right upstairs.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Right above you?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Right above me.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","..All the time..","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","(Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","You can't believe what I just did.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","What? What did you do?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","What did you do?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","How could I have done that?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Done what?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Elaine's moving into your building?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yes. Right above me.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Right above you?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yes.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","You're gonna be neighbors.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I know. Neighbors.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","She's right above you?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Right above me.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","How could you do that?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","But I need the home bed advantage!","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Of course, we all do.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and sit with me.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","I was just in there. It's embarrassing.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Oh, who's gonna know?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","They saw me walk out.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Two minutes.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Tough.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","If they were fanatic about showers, they might.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yeah, the guy with the flat head?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","(Joking) I wonder if that's really true.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Thanks a lot. I""ll give it back to you in a week.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","I'm not doing that.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Boys, boys.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Hi, Jerry.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What?","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny yells) Because it's true!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks in Spanish)","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) You know, I used to think that the","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","What happened to you?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","So, she can't get the apartment.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Can't get it.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","So, she doesn't move in.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","And how does the baldness fit into that plan?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Into the intercom) Elaine?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","'Cause you know, I love Elaine.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Of course you do.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, ""Why stand when","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I know.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","How am I going to get five thousand dollars?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I have no idea.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Hey, my new neighbor!","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","I'm not moving in.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","What?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","They want five thousand dollars now.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","So, okay. What's the problem?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","I don't have five thousand dollars.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","No, that's too much money to borrow.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Loan her the money. You can afford it.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","She doesn't want to borrow the money.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Of course I'd pay you back..","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Yeah, so what's the problem?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Who said there's a problem?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","He said he'd loan you the money.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","That's okay. He doesn't care.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","You know, money can sometimes come between friends.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Get outta here.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Let me think about it.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","What's to think about?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it. (Leaves)","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","You didn't want her in the building?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","No, I didn't!","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I","the-apartment",10
"I"," I","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Because I'm a pod?","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","I'll take it!","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","Hi, Elaine..","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's the one who got me my new","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","So, you're Elaine's hero.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Yeah, it's my life's work.","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","There are so few true heros left in this world. (Jerry's attracted to Roxanne, Elaine notices)","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","(Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts selecting food from the tables)","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","I wish we had a view of the finish line.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.","the-apartment",10
"RITA","Is she here?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","No, she's working.","the-apartment",10
"RITA","What does she do?","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. What about you?","the-apartment",10
"RITA","I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. (George is stunned) Anyway, she's a","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","But.. (She leaves, George is standing there)","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","Hi Stan. Joanne.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!","the-apartment",10
"JOANNE","Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Fantastic..","the-apartment",10
"STAN","She can pop in whenever she wants.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I know.","the-apartment",10
"JOANNE","She doesn't even need to knock!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","It's tremendous.","the-apartment",10
"STAN","Anytime of day.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I'm in heaven.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment.","the-apartment",10
"RITA","Oh, Hi. (Calling to someone) bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh flirtingly)","the-apartment",10
"SUSIE","So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.","the-apartment",10
"SUSIE","That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)","the-apartment",10
"RITA","Hey everybody! Here come the runners!","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Na..","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as","the-apartment",10
"JANICE","I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","(Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!","the-apartment",10
"JANICE","Please.. (Walks away)","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This is an idiot.","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please,","the-apartment",10
"ROXANNE","(Yelling out the window) You're all winners!","the-apartment",10
"GEORGE","But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","(Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What? What's cool?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Elaine.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","What are you talking about?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","(Nods) Cash.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Who would pay that much?","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","He's in the music business.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Wow. You're right. That is loud.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","It's just unbelievable.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","They rehearse all the time?","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","I'm not going up. It stinks up there.","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","Manny..","the-apartment",10
"MANNY","(In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.","the-apartment",10
"HAROLD","I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.","the-apartment",10
"ELAINE","Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.","the-apartment",10
"KRAMER","(Talking about the music) Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh..shh.... shhh... shhh.. Doesn't work, 'cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a Shh. ""Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me."" Some people you can't shush in a movie theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it. They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables.","the-apartment",10
"THE END"," THE END","the-apartment",10
"JERRY","I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!"" You turn it over, giant printing, ""Not even close!"" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, ""Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest.""","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Trying to get the box through the door. To Kramer) To the right. (They get it through)","the-statue",11

"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Don't get up.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","I'd like to help, but my neck..","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","So how long has it been in the basement?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","What's in it?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","(Pulls out some socks) You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They don't like it.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Now this, I like.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.","the-statue",11

"GEORGE","Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","What?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"", and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,"" and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","C'mon, George. I saw it first.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","No, I got dibs!","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Potato man!","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Okay.. start with me.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Yeah, good, good.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","No, no, no, no.. I'm ""it"". I win.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, he's it. He wins. ""It"" is good.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Do over - start with him.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Alright, c'mon. Let's go.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme song)","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue down) Aren't you gonna take it?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.","the-statue",11
"GOERGE","(To Kramer) What about your stuff?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws them into his apartment, and leaves)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","What?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","The Inka-dink.. you were ""It"".","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","""It""'s bad?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","""It"" very bad.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","You told them that?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Of course.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Oh, probably caught in traffic.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","(Serious) Or maybe he's dead.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Joking) So what do you write, children's books?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","That's Ray.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. (Bows)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Taken aback) ..Alright.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","And we have to get back to work. (She exits with Elaine)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Rushed) I gotta get to the airport.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."" And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?""","the-statue",11
"JERRY","He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","There's no Rubber Man.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","I'm leaving.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Where are you going?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","(To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Demand. (The sound of locks being unlocked can be heard) There's Ray.. late as usual.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, ""Jerry the First,"" gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.","the-statue",11
"RAY","But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","The water is boiling. Are you having tea?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE AND RAY","Yes.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Jerry? ..Jerry!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Snaps out of it) What?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","(From the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?","the-statue",11
"RAY","Yeah, I'm coming!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","What statue?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I had a statue!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","You have a statue? I never saw a statue.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","My grandfather gave me a statue!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Since when?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Do you take sugar?","the-statue",11
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Uhh.. no.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Do you realize what you're saying?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Lemon?","the-statue",11
"JERRY AND ELAINE","(Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah..","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Are you sure?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Ninety-nine percent sure?!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.","the-statue",11
"RAY","The pastries!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","I never saw the statue.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I had a statue! What should I do?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","I don't know.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and dials)","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?","the-statue",11
"RAY","I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","(Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Oh, how about dinner?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Let's go get him.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yeah, right.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","We can't just let him get away with this.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","You wanta go get him?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Who is this Rava?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","I say we get him.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","No!","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Let me just call him.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","(Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Oh, he stole it?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?","the-statue",11
"JERRY AND GEORGE","No.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o' clock.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his ""M.O.""","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Remember, don't take any crap.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","I'll be right here.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) Ray?","the-statue",11
"RAY","(Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","..Well, I didn't..","the-statue",11
"RAY","Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(Muttering to himself) I wonder why.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Give it back?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-statue",11
"RAY","What are you talking about?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","What are you talking about?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(Muttering) What is he talking about..","the-statue",11
"RAY","I'm talking about the statue.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yeah, me too.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Give it back to whom?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Me.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) Yeah, him.","the-statue",11
"RAY","You?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Yeah. Me.","the-statue",11
"RAY","I'm not getting this.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) You already got it.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.","the-statue",11
"RAY","What are you saying?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","What am I saying?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) Take a wild guess.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Are you saying I stole your statue?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) What a mind.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Well, I..","the-statue",11
"RAY","I can't believe what I'm hearing.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I can't believe what I'm hearing.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.","the-statue",11
"RAY","For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To Himself) A pawn shop?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","A pawn shop?","the-statue",11
"RAY","Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) And cleaning them out.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.","the-statue",11
"RAY","What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(To himself) Again with the Rava.","the-statue",11
"RAY","You want her.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.","the-statue",11
"RAY","(Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I know Finland. They're neutral.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(Mocking) ""Oh, I find you so charming"" ..You wuss.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(To George) Did you call me a wuss?","the-statue",11
"RAY","What did you say?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","I said luss.. I'm at a luss..","the-statue",11
"RAY","I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.","the-statue",11
"RAY","And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?","the-statue",11
"RAY","If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.","the-statue",11
"GEORGGE","That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Pleading) George.","the-statue",11
"RAY","(To Jerry) Who is this?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!","the-statue",11
"RAY","What's going on here?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","GUILTY!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Your friend is crazy.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Oh, I'm crazy!","the-statue",11
"JERRY","(Still pleading) George, george..","the-statue",11
"RAY","I've got to get going. I have a class.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","You mean alias.","the-statue",11
"RAY","You are starting to make me angry.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Well, that was bound to happen!","the-statue",11
"RAY","(To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes to leave)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Hey, Ray.","the-statue",11
"RAY","(Stops) Yes?","the-statue",11
"JERRY","How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Nervous?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Why should I be?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Yeah. Right.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Your notes are very insightful.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","The book is great. Did you go out last night?","the-statue",11
"RAVA","No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","They all are..","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Was Jerry?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","I can't remember..","the-statue",11
"RAVA","You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","(Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","I admit nothing!","the-statue",11
"MAN","Will you put that cigarette out, please?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Maybe you think we're in cahoots.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Yes, that's all, a coincidence!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","A big coincidence.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","No, that's a big coincidence.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","No, there are degrees of coincidences.","the-statue",11
"RAVA","No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!..","the-statue",11
"MAN","Will you put that cigarette out?!","the-statue",11
"RAVA","(Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","I'm not happy about this.","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Really?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","(Casually) Sure. Why not?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Can't you talk to your boss?","the-statue",11
"ELAINE","I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","I'm not happy about this.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Yeah.. He'll have my parents!","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Police! Open up!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall - face first)","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Freeze, mother!","the-statue",11
"RAY","Hey..","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.","the-statue",11
"RAY","Murder?!","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!","the-statue",11
"RAY","I think you have me confused with somebody else.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","(Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?","the-statue",11
"RAY","Yeah.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","(Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)","the-statue",11
"RAY","Hey, hey, are you a cop?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?","the-statue",11
"RAY","Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-statue",11
"JERRY","Kramer, what did you do?","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.","the-statue",11
"GEORGE","I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!","the-statue",11
"KRAMER","Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground)","the-statue",11
"JERRY","People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.","the-statue",11
"THE END"," THE END","the-statue",11
"LEVITAN","Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get","the-revenge",12
"GEORGE","That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.","the-revenge",12
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-revenge",12
"JERRY","Hey.","the-revenge",12
"KRAMER","Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last","the-revenge",12
"JERRY","Well, what'd you say?","the-revenge",12
"KRAMER","I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I","the-revenge",12
"JERRY","What's his problem?","the-revenge",12
"KRAMER","No job. No women.","the-revenge",12
"JERRY","He called the right guy.","the-revenge",12
"KRAMER","What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live","the-revenge",12

"DOCTOR","Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Really?","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","It happens.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","What? You mean with a knife?","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Hey.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","No? That's good.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","I have to have my tonsils taken out.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Well, what should I do, Kramer?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Well, for one think, don't listen to him.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Eckman? I thought he was doing time?","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","He's holistic, George. He's holistic.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Holistic.. that sounds right.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","George, you need a medical doctor.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Sorry.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","What month were you born?","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","April.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Really?","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","Do you use hot water in the shower?","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","Stop using it.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","..Okay.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","I'm off hot water.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Yes, yes I am.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Still on the hot water) What about shaving?","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","I guess so.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","Uh-huh.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","I love crampbark.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","Cleavers.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","And some couchgrass.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Go ahead, drink it, George.","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read.","the-heart-attack",13
"TOR","(Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. ""Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Go ahead, drink it, George.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","(In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","(To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","I don't even like Chuckles!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","(Angry, to Driver) Pull over!","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","Yeah!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","You're gonna fight?","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","Now?! I'm a mutant!","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","(To Driver) Hey, let me drive.","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","Come on, man. Pull over!","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!","the-heart-attack",13
"ASSISTANT","I'm gonna kick his ass.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","(To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?","the-heart-attack",13
"GEORGE","You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","All this for a Chuckle.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","What's a Chuckle?","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","Can you let go of my tongue now?","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","What?","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","Let go of my tongue!","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","(Lets go) Oh, sorry.","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?","the-heart-attack",13
"DOCTOR","I was going to kiss you good night.","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","You just can't leave him out there.","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","I told him I was gonna mess him up.","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","Well, can you call him an ambulance?","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!","the-heart-attack",13
"KRAMER","hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!","the-heart-attack",13
"DRIVER","(Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY AND KRAMER","Watch out!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his","the-heart-attack",13
"ELAINE","Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","Hey, check the TV.","the-heart-attack",13
"TV VOICE","(Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so","the-heart-attack",13
"MAN","Aaahhhgggg!","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter","the-heart-attack",13
"THE END"," THE END","the-heart-attack",13
"JERRY","I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, ""What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","He was good in Man From Uncle.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, I don't wanna see the naked people.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Been a while?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What was that look?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What look?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","The look you just gave me.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I gave a look?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Yes.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What kind of look?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I know that look.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Then what was it?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Why should I tell you?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What about the look?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","You got something on your mind?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No. Things pop into your head. You?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Things occur to me from time to time.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","No, of course not.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Thirty-seven.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","We know the terrain.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No big surprises.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Nope.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What do you think?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I don't know. What do you think?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, it's something to consider.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I mean, let's say we did.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What if.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Is that like the end of the world or something?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Certainly not.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I know.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","It's almost stupid if we didn't.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","It's moronic.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Absurd!","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","We, there are always a few.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Devastating.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)","the-deal",14
"JERRY","That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Huh.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Right.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","All right, sir.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well now we're gettin' somewhere.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What about the kiss goodnight?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Tough one. You're call.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","It's brug-wa (?).","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Fine. Well.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Well.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You ready?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Ready.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","So think you can handle this?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Hey.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Got the paper?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Not yet.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","No paper?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I haven't been out yet.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I thought you'd like that.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Oh, this is huge!","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I know.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","All right, okay. Let's go, details.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, I can't do details.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","You wha?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I can't give details.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","No details?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I'm not in the mood.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!","the-deal",14
"JERRY","All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Where are you sitting?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","On the couch.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Next to each other?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, separated.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Time?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","About eleven.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Okay, go ahead.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Boy, these are really bad details.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Better than before?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Not exactly.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Not exactly. What does that mean?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I think we've worked out a system.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Okay. No calls the next day.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You ready for the second one?","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Spending the night. Optional.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","No, you see? You got greedy.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, that's the rule. It's optional.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I think you're wrong.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","I hope I am.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Is this yours or the roommate's?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","The roommate's.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Would she mind?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","She keeps track of everything.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Thanks.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, guess I'll get going.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Fine, go away.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Just go.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I'm having surgery tomorrow.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","But you said, it can be very serious.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Okay, so fine. Go.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","It has nothing to do with whose house it is.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)","the-deal",14
"TINA","Hi.","the-deal",14
"TINA","Hi, Jerry.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Hi.","the-deal",14
"TINA","Such a great improv class tonight.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh really?","the-deal",14
"TINA","I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?","the-deal",14
"TINA","Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","What are you doing?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I can't go if you're mad.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I'm not mad.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You seemed a little mad.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","So you're okay with everything?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Definitely. Are you?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Definitely. Well, goodnight.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Rules.","the-deal",14
"TINA","Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I think I heard her say something about a bench.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","A bench? What kind of a bench?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What, like at a bus stop?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Like a park bench?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I have no idea.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Who puts a bench in their house?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Forget the bench.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Nice looking fellow.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What about candle holders?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Too romantic.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Lingerie?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Too sexual.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Waffle maker.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Too domestic.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Too Gubernatorial. (?)","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Let's work on the card.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Maybe you won't like it.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You could not like it.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Just the fact that you remembered means everything.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Cash?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Would do you think?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","You got me cash?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Who are you, my uncle?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Pal? You think I'm your pal?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I said, ""and more.""","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I am not your pal.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh, what is this? You got me something?","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Yeah. Open it.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","That's pretty good, huh?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Great.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well goody for you.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","182 bucks.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","(To Jerry) Yates.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Oh Kramer. (They embrace)","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Could you excuse us please?","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","What?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","We're talking.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You know, we never had one fight before this deal.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I know.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Never.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Ever.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","We got along beautifully.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Like clams.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","It was wonderful.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","A pleasure.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I can't do it.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You what?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","I can't do that.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","This, that, and the other.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","You.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","(Starts to correct then realizes) Well...","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","I never should have made up those rules.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Why?","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","What did you end up giving her?","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","91 dollars.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Sorry about that.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","So what're you gonna do?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","So, maybe this should be it.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Could be it.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","She seems like an it.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","We'd have to kill him.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Plus, you know what else.","the-deal",14
"GEORGE","You better call her.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Hey.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","You got the paper yet?","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","No.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Well, you're not reading it now.","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","All right, you can take it. But I want it back.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?","the-deal",14
"ELAINE","Ah, this. And that.","the-deal",14
"JERRY","And the other.","the-deal",14
"KRAMER","Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)","the-deal",14
"THE END"," THE END","the-deal",14
"JERRY","Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","She's the performance artist, right?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","Todd.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","No, he's not.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","By marriage.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Thin ice, George. Thin ice..","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","She stopped performing.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances"".","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","It was an accident!","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","What ever happened with the shirt?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","But?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","My roommate has Lyme disease.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","How did she get Lyme disease?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","They still do that play?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","It's a classic.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","With all the nudity?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","What do you wanna know?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","Rarely.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","No.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","When is this suppose to be?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","Saturday.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","And if you do?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","What are you doing this for? Look at you..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Pleading) Leave me alone.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","I'm not getting illegal cable!","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","No, I read in the paper..","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","(Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Well, they might hook us up again.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the ""Big Mammoo."" (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","What you're suggesting is illegal.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","It's not illegal.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","It's against the law.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Well, yeah.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","(Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","A real human rights nut, huh?","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Yeah. He's intense, man.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","I don't know. What if I get caught?","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.","the-baby-shower",15
"TABACHNICK","Tomarrow okay.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's","the-baby-shower",15
"MAN","Mr. Steinfeld?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Seinfeld.","the-baby-shower",15
"MAN","We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","My cable hook-up? What about it?","the-baby-shower",15
"MAN","It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.","the-baby-shower",15
"MAN","You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian","the-baby-shower",15
"TABACHNICK","Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.","the-baby-shower",15
"KRAMER","No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?","the-baby-shower",15
"STEWARDESS","I'm afraid not.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?","the-baby-shower",15
"STEWARDESS","No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?","the-baby-shower",15
"BILL","My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Sounds like a rough trip.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","So, the college cancelled the gig?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Modestly) Forget it.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","No, really.. an airport run.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","It's nothing.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Hey, it's one thing if I asked you ""Could you do me a favor?"" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything -","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","You want to get a bite?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Well, so what should we do?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Nervous) What are you talking about?","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","You're wearing the chocolate shirt!","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","I am? What a strange coincidence..","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","(Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.","the-baby-shower",15
"JERRY","What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?","the-baby-shower",15
"GEORGE","No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, ""Remember this","the-baby-shower",15
"LESLIE","We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.","the-baby-shower",15
"ELAINE","So, where's Todd?","the-baby-shower",15
"LESLIE","Up in Hyannisport.","the-baby-shower",15

"JERRY","Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!""","the-chinese-restaurant",16

"JERRY","Who was in town on a business venture, and um..","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","On some people.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Oooh.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.","the-busboy",17

"ELAINE","I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Oh, I said it in a kidding way.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","I didn't know he'd get fired.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Was it my fault?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Was it my fault?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of","the-busboy",17

"JERRY","Oh, like you do.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Scoffing) Camp.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Elaine?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","(Through intercom) Yeah.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Then why don't you try and get him another job?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","What? Did you get the busboy's number?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","How did you get all this?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","(Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","You, you're going now?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","It'll take to long.","the-busboy",17

"KRAMER","Take me where? Where?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","What am I gonna say?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Well, I'm not an idiot.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Certainly not.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Then we're cool.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","This is a guy I know.. Kramer.","the-busboy",17

"ANTONIO","Si.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Como se dice.. waterbed?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","(Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","You got anything to drink? Agua?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Hurry up.","the-busboy",17
"ANTONIO","(Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","His cat's gone.","the-busboy",17
"ANTONIO","(Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","(Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","(Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him,","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Oh? How do you figure?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Why was I in charge of closing the door?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","So!","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","Let me talk to him.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","No hello?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","So, you two been, uh..","the-busboy",17
"ELAIEN","No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","What's your airport route?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","..What about the Van Wyck?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Oooh.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","You still using that old alarm clock?","the-busboy",17
"ELAIEN","Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!","the-busboy",17
"ED","9:15?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Yes! 9:15!","the-busboy",17
"ED","(Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get","the-busboy",17
"ED","Can I shower?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!","the-busboy",17
"ED","I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase.","the-busboy",17
"ED","The kitchen.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","The kitchen?!","the-busboy",17
"ED","I've got a bag of cashews in there.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!","the-busboy",17
"ED","What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!","the-busboy",17
"ED","I'll never make it.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Don't say that!","the-busboy",17
"ED","But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Shut up and pack!","the-busboy",17
"ED","And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","You're talking too much!","the-busboy",17
"ED","Where's my sweater?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","What?!","the-busboy",17
"ED","My brown sweater.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","What? What sweater?","the-busboy",17
"ED","My brown sweater.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","You didn't bring a brown sweater.","the-busboy",17
"ED","I brought a brown sweater.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!","the-busboy",17
"ED","That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)","the-busboy",17
"ED","What are you doing?!","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)","the-busboy",17
"ED","My shoes. You packed my shoes.","the-busboy",17

"JERRY","Where are you going?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.","the-busboy",17
"KRAMER","No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..","the-busboy",17

"GEORGE","(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?","the-busboy",17

"JERRY","He'll get another job. He's a busboy!","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","So, much longer?","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.","the-busboy",17
"ELAINE","Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)","the-busboy",17
"GEORGE","I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.","the-busboy",17
"JERRY","Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?","the-busboy",17

"JERRY","I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? ""You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: ""No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back.""","the-pen",20

"HELEN","You could have used our car.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","I don't wanna use your car.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","What's wrong with our car?","the-pen",20

"HELEN","We don't use it.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","What are you talking? We use it.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","So what would you do? You'd hitch?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","How much is a rent-a-car?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","I don't know. 25 bucks a day.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","What? You're crazy.","the-pen",20

"JERRY","God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","The lake isn't real.","the-pen",20

"HELEN","Will you stop?","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)","the-pen",20
"HELEN","(asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","No that's not such a good idea.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Well I tought that...","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Not now. She's right inside.","the-pen",20

"JERRY","Shh! Nothing, nothing.","the-pen",20

"MORTY","(still loud) What about her?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","(Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","He's an idealist.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","What the hell are you looking for?","the-pen",20

"JERRY","What kind of pen is that?","the-pen",20
"JACK","This pen?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-pen",20
"JACK","This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?","the-pen",20
"JACK","Oh it was a gift.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works.","the-pen",20

"HELEN","You didn't have to take it.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","He offered it to me.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Because you made such a big fuss about it.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)","the-pen",20
"JERRY","He could have said: ""Thank you, I like it too"" and put it back in his pocket.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","He loves that pen.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Oh come on!","the-pen",20
"HELEN","He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","He didn't think you'd accpet.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Well, he was wrong.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at their argument)","the-pen",20
"JERRY","So you want me to return it?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Yes.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Hey I don't even want the pen now!","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside down.","the-pen",20

"HELEN","Blanche.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","What are you talking about?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)","the-pen",20

"JERRY","Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","What happened to your eyes?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Well I started to go under...","the-pen",20
"HELEN","With the instructor?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I told you...","the-pen",20
"JACK","Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","My back hurts.","the-pen",20
"JACK","Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","We got plenty of time.","the-pen",20
"JACK","(to Jerry) What happened to you?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","It's from scuba diving.","the-pen",20
"JACK","What's there to see underwater?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.","the-pen",20
"JACK","You what?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he tends the pen to Jack)","the-pen",20
"JACK","Well I mean...","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Take it.","the-pen",20
"JACK","All right! (he smiles and take it)","the-pen",20
"MORTY","You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.","the-pen",20
"JACK","Whose pen?","the-pen",20
"MORTY","His pen.","the-pen",20
"JACK","This happens to be my pen.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","You didn't give it to him.","the-pen",20
"JACK","What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Where do you come off with this crap?","the-pen",20
"JACK","Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?","the-pen",20
"MORTY","You said you didn't want it!","the-pen",20
"JACK","Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?","the-pen",20
"JACK","Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!","the-pen",20
"JACK","Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!","the-pen",20

"MORTY","You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!","the-pen",20
"JACK","Listen do you think I give a damn?","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?","the-pen",20
"MORTY","yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Well. This should be a very interesting evening.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?","the-pen",20
"PHOTOGRAPHER","Say astronaut.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","Say what? (laughing) Say what?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Astronaut?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","Say it.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(to Leo) Uncle Leo.","the-pen",20

"JERRY","(to Stella) Her back hurts.","the-pen",20
"STELLA","Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week.","the-pen",20
"LEO","I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","No, no.","the-pen",20
"LEO","You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!","the-pen",20
"LEO","Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!","the-pen",20
"LEO","You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.","the-pen",20
"STELLA","(to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.","the-pen",20
"JACK","(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)","the-pen",20
"JACK","Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)","the-pen",20
"HELEN","(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.","the-pen",20
"JACK","His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.","the-pen",20
"JACK","But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)","the-pen",20
"MORTY","(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)","the-pen",20

"JACK","He gave it to me!","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Come on. That's enough, sit down!","the-pen",20
"JACK","I'm not sitting down!","the-pen",20
"JACK","Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you.

"HELEN","Jerry, do your act.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","They're all gonna leave.","the-pen",20

"CHIROPRACTOR","I'm afraid not.","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(discouraged) Five days. Here.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!","the-pen",20
"JERRY","(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...","the-pen",20

"JERRY","Nothing.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","Good morning.","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Hi Evelyn.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I don't think so.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I'll ask him when he gets up.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?","the-pen",20
"HELEN","I was very comfortable.","the-pen",20
"EVELYN","Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.","the-pen",20
"HELEN","It's in the constitution.","the-pen",20

"CHIROPRACTOR","I'm a chiropractor.","the-pen",20
"MORTY","What are you kidding me?","the-pen",20
"ELAINE","(to Jerry) Five more days?","the-pen",20
"JERRY","Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)","the-pen",20

"GEORGE","Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down","the-library",22
"JERRY","That was double overtime.","the-library",22
"GEORGE","So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move.","the-library",22

"GEORGE","It was.","the-library",22

"JERRY","All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.","the-library",22
"HEYMAN","Can't Stand Ya'.","the-library",22
"GEORGE","Yes Mr. Hayman.","the-library",22
"HEYMAN","Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.","the-library",22
"GEORGE","Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.","the-library",22
"HEYMAN","Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?","the-library",22
"GEORGE","I'm not really sure, I...","the-library",22
"HEYMAN","Well let's take a look.","the-library",22

"ELAINE","No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!","the-library",22

"IN SINGLE FILE","GEORGE, JERRY and ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.","the-parking-garage",23
"HEAVY BOX."," HEAVY BOX.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","One left...what a joke.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","You can have this one.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Hey, I didn't get one either.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","This is what people do.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Big accomplishment. GEORGE Fish. What do they do?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","What do you do?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","(RE: CAR) It's this way.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","What time is it?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Five o'clock.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Always late. Always late.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You're not late.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Who?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Isn't it going the other way?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","What's the matter?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You want me to help you with that?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","No, no, I got it.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","(TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","If you like her, go talk to her.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, ""Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?""","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","She's fat.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Oh she's fat?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","What?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Where's the car?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","I thought it was here.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","You don't know where we parked?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Oh, this is great.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","I didn't pay attention.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","This is just what I need.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","I'm sure it's right around here.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","It's over there. I know where it is.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","It's black, right?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Dark blue.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.","the-parking-garage",23
"THEY STOP..."," THEY STOP...","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Hmmm...I thought it was...","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Didn't we come in over there?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I thought it was over there.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","About two hours.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","You'd better find this car.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","It's this way...","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I really have to go to the bathroom.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Why? Nobody's around.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I'll wait.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. JERRY Alright.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","There it is!...No that's not it.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","...Six wrong?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Those school zones are a killer.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Will you let me help you with that?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","I'm gonna put it down behind that car.","the-parking-garage",23
"HE DOES SO."," HE DOES SO.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Pink eleven. Remember that.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Look at this place. It's huge...","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, ""Make sure you hang on to your jacket.""","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Where the hell is this car, Kramer?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","It's got to be here.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Maybe it's not on this level.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","What?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","It felt like a couple of levels.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You should always carry a pad and pen. GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","I have a pen.","the-parking-garage",23
"THEY REACT..."," THEY REACT...","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, ""Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.""","the-parking-garage",23
"MOTHER","Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Look at that woman.","the-parking-garage",23
"MOTHER","I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Hey, is that necessary?","the-parking-garage",23
"MOTHER","Why don't you mind your own business?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.","the-parking-garage",23
"KID","You're ugly.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","...What?","the-parking-garage",23
"KID","You're ugly.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","You are!","the-parking-garage",23
"KID","You are!","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","(RE CAR) I found it!","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","He's got it.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Oh...no.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Jerry, look at my fish.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","His eyes look a little cloudy.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Oh are they gonna be furious.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","It was easy the last time.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","No one's going to do that.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Five minutes.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","We're not wilding.","the-parking-garage",23
"THEY LEAVE."," THEY LEAVE.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny - These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Right here at the mall.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Excuse me...","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","You drank a whole bottle of water.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I know.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","So why don't you just go?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","No I can't.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Don't you get tired of following rules?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You think I'm too cautious?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Buddy Hackett?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","He's a comedian.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","I know.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","All right. All right.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","(pointing) You can go over here.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I can manage.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)","the-parking-garage",23
"HE NUDGES JERRY."," HE NUDGES JERRY.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Okay, okay. I'll be right back.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Okay, let's go. Come with me.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","But...","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Come on.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","...Kramer","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Well you're still not allowed.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","That's up to you.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","So you don't care if I die.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","It was life and death.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Uh huh.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","I don't know.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","You can tell the police all about it.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Jerry!","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Jerry!","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","No, no, I'll be back.","the-parking-garage",23
"SHE LEAVES."," SHE LEAVES.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Does that bother you?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","Not at all.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","I know what you did.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Yeah I'm sure.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","But why? Why can't you do it?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","But why? Why don't you want to?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.","the-parking-garage",23
"CAR."," CAR.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Really.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Who's Killer Kowalski?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I've gotta go to the bathroom.","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","So go.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Here?","the-parking-garage",23
"KRAMER","You and Jerry.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...","the-parking-garage",23
"SECURITY GUARD","Oh your folks have an anniversary today too? Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","A Red Chinese prison?","the-parking-garage",23

"INT. PARKING GARAGE"," INT. PARKING GARAGE","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Jerry! Over here...","the-parking-garage",23
"NOW THEY SPOT HER."," NOW THEY SPOT HER.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Where have you been?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I was arrested for urinating.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Me too.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","You what?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Look at my fish...","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Is he...","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","No, but he's not looking good...","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Elaine, shut-up.","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Hey, where's Kramer?","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","I thought he was with you.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Look at the time, that's it.","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? GEORGE We came in over there!","the-parking-garage",23
"ELAINE","We didn't come in over there! JERRY Where's Kramer?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Hey George, there she is again. ...","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","So what do you want me to do?","the-parking-garage",23
"JERRY","Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","That is an opening.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...","the-parking-garage",23
"AMY","Oh sure, I'll drive you around.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","You will?","the-parking-garage",23
"AMY","Sure.","the-parking-garage",23
"GEORGE","Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.","the-parking-garage",23
"AMY","I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.","the-parking-garage",23

"GEORGE","She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","What's that smell? What are you wearing?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Little cologne.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Manly.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Monica wants me to wear it.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","So why didn't you say no?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I'm too nice.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","She wants me to take an IQ test.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","You know, I can't talk to you anymore.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Who thinks you're smart?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.","the-cafe",24

"JERRY","What did you get?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","What did I get or what do I say I got?","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","I tell you everything, right?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","I hope so.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Well, this I take to the grave.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Why do you keep watching?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","And then you flush.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Well, it's a spider.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Bazooka Joe.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","The buzzer.","the-cafe",24

"JERRY","Come on up.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Casus belli.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","What's that?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Go in, go in!","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Have you gone in there?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Hi.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I'm wearing some cologne, all right?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Sure, fine.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Casus belli.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Casus belli.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Since when do you wear cologne?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I didn't take it yet.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","What IQ test?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","What's casus belli.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Oh, it's nothing...","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Is it about me?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Oh, that sounds like fun.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","You'll do well, you're smart.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","What did you get on your SAT's?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","It varies.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","You know, I don't even know my IQ.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Mine's 145.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","145!","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Get out of here!","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","You get out of here!","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","You get out of here!","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","You should take the test for me.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","What?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Are you serious?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Where would I take the test?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","No, that would be too noisy.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Hey, what do you think?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Hey, I love a good caper.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","You'll do it?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","What the hey.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Yeaah, beautiful...(They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...","the-cafe",24

"JERRY","Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?","the-cafe",24
"BABU","Oh, the turkey.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...","the-cafe",24
"JERRY THINKS","Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a nobel price?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","But why?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I can't concentrate in front of you.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Good luck.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Don't need it.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.","the-cafe",24

"KRAMER","Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","So?","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Well, I'm not giving it back.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Why not?","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Oh, gees...","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Yeah, ok...(takes the test and goes to another table.)","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Statute.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","What?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","No, statue.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Statute.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Oh, I really think you're wrong.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","What test?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","An IQ test.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Why do you take an IQ test?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","It's for George.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","George?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Why are you taking an IQ test for George?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Would you please?!","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","What, is it for a job or something?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Later!","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","You're positive it's statute?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Yes, yes!","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","Yeah?","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","The door is locked.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Oh, it's locked?","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","I need to get something.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","George!","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Wish I could.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","Ladadeeda, laadadeeda....","the-cafe",24

"BABU","Please, forgive me, please...","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Go ahead, I'll take care of it.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","It's all right, she was cheating anyway.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","You're a very kind man.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Babu, you're Pakistani?","the-cafe",24
"BABU","Yes, Pakistani, yes.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Babu, may I say something?","the-cafe",24
"BABU","Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","But there are no Pakistani people here.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","Yes, you see everything, don't you?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Well, not everything. I do what I can.","the-cafe",24
"BABU","I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, very special.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY THINKING","I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","It was an accident.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","What did you go on a picnic?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Babu Bhatt did it.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Time's up George.","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Ok. (George opens the door.) Here you go.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","How did you do?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Piece of cake.","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","What? I spilled some food on it.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Food? What food?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","What are you talking about?","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Where did you get food?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","From my pocket.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","What?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","And coffee?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Where did you get the coffee?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, from the grocery store.","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","I walked.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.","the-cafe",24

"MONICA","You climbed out the window?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Of course.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","Why didn't you go out the door?","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.","the-cafe",24
"MONICA","You are a fascinating man, George Costanza.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","You're very special.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Of course, I always do.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","Just give it back to him.","the-cafe",24
"KRAMER","Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)","the-cafe",24

"ELAINE","Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Oh, hello professor.","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","George, I cannot believe...","the-cafe",24
"GEORGE","Please...","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","No there has got be a mistake.","the-cafe",24

"JERRY","But an 85?","the-cafe",24
"ELAINE","There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.","the-cafe",24
"JERRY MOCKING","It was a madhouse.","the-cafe",24

"BABU","You wish to eat?","the-cafe",24
"JERRY","Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.","the-cafe",24

"GEORGE","""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!""","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","That was no good?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","I didn't say anything.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","I'm gonna go break up with Owen.","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you","the-alternate-side",28

"JERRY","Kramer.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","What happened here?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance,","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","What extremities?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","What's an extremity?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","You raise the feet, get blood to the head.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","I don't have a washcloth.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Well use a paper towel.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","You can't put a paper towel on his head.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","What about a big sponge?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","How you gonna hold it on there?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Use a belt.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Should we walk him around?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE AND KRAMER","Yes, yes.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Yeah, I've seen them do that.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","No, no that's for a drug overdose.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Maybe that's what he's got.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","He is not a drug addict!","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","A cookie!","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Can you give him a cookie?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","How's he gonna chew it?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Cookies don't liquefy.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Alright I'll get a blender.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","What blender? I don't have a blender.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","You got a blender.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","I would know if I had a blender.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Where is the ambulance?!","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","I can't believe what's going on out here.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)","the-alternate-side",28
"VOICE","Paramedics.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Come on up. Okay, they're here.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","He seems to be breathing.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","I know.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Almost.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","It's not an easy thing to bring up.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Yeah, that's true.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","He does, how'd you know that?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","I could tell.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","What happened, what took you so long?!","the-alternate-side",28
"PARAMEDIC","We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Oh man.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","What happened to the car?","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen)","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","This guy I'm seeing.","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","What happened?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","We don't know!","the-alternate-side",28
"PARAMEDIC","Who put cookies in his mouth?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Cookies?","the-alternate-side",28
"PARAMEDIC","You're not supposed to do that.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","So how'd you hit the car?","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","It's not even my car, it's a rental.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Woody mentioned me? What did he say?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Should I apologize to Woody?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Well I know how to drive.","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Can I get anybody anything?","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","I put my pants on, Sid.","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Maybe I could call my father.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Hey, you seen the paper yet?","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","The extent of the damage would have been far less severe","the-alternate-side",28
"SID","Oh lord.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Can he communicate?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before,","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","What community? There's a community?","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Of course there's a community.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.","the-alternate-side",28
"AGENT","Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred","the-alternate-side",28

"AGENT","You're not covered for other drivers.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Other drivers?","the-alternate-side",28
"AGENT","Um hm.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car.","the-alternate-side",28
"AGENT","Not that particular one.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you","the-alternate-side",28
"AGENT","Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of","the-alternate-side",28
"AGENT","Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","These pretzels are making me thirsty.","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","An overdose of odor? Good question.","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Do I smell?","the-alternate-side",28

"GEORGE","No no no, I got it.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Please.","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","What are you doing here?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","I got fired from the movie.","the-alternate-side",28
"GEORGE","Get out of here, why?","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it","the-alternate-side",28
"ELAINE","Aww.","the-alternate-side",28
"KRAMER","Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.","the-alternate-side",28
"THE END"," THE END","the-alternate-side",28
"JERRY","I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Like you do.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Why did France give that to us anyway?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","It was a gift.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","So countries just exchange gifts like that?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","If they like each other.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","There's Elaine.","the-red-dot",29

"ELAINE","One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Told you.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Do I really have to buy her something?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?","the-red-dot",29

"JERRY","Well I can see it.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Yeah, but you know where it is.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","You want me to take an overview?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Please.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yeah so?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Oh boy, can you smell it?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","No. I can't smell it.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","You don't always smell someone from a drink.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yes you do.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yes you would.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","Okay.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Would you take a drink and let us smell you?","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","You can smell me without the drink.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","All right.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I don't smell anything.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Maybe we're too close to the bottle.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","(over the speaker) It's George.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Hello everybody.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","(uncomfortablly) Thank you.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Hey what's that?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","It's an early Christmas present.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Christmas present? For who?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","For you.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Kramer. Yeah that'll do.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Of course it's cashmere.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Oh, I love cashmere.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Well who doesn't.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","My, George this must have cost a fortune.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Ahh, money.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","What's that red dot on your sweater?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","What?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","What don't you know?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Well do you see it or don't you?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Ahem. Say that again?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Do you see it or don't you?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Now what did you ask me again.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","You're still here. You're a dynamo.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","I can't believe I get paid for this.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","I'll see you tomorrow.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","How you doing?","the-red-dot",29
"CLEANING LADY","Hello.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Why is that?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Convulsing?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Convulsing?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I don't know, I'm trying to help you.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","You don't drink.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","So you started drinking.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","So how was it?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Good thing the cleaning lady was there.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Dick was fired.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","What are you saying?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","I'm not saying anything.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","You're saying something.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","What could I be saying?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","If I was saying something I would have said it.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Well why don't you say it?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","I said it.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","What did you say?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","(over the speaker) It's George.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","No I didn't.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","How much did he save?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Did you tell her anything?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","No.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Do you swear?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Oh you told her didn't you.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","No.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","What? Did I what?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","You did didn't you.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Well Jerry told me that you did.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","This is for you.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","Okay, okay, can I open it now?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","Oh! Is that cashmere?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Of course it's cashemere.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Just a little something for Christmas.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Take it off. You're going to ruin it.","the-red-dot",29
"LADY","(noticing the dot) What's this?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","The only stench is comming from you.","the-red-dot",29
"AUDIENCE","Oooooh.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","It's off the wagon.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","I don't know.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","What the hell do you know about wagons?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I know enough not to get on them.","the-red-dot",29
"BOSS","I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Who said that?","the-red-dot",29
"BOSS","She did.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.","the-red-dot",29
"BOSS","You're fired.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Well you didn't have to say it like that.","the-red-dot",29
"BOSS","I want you out of here by the end of the day.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?","the-red-dot",29
"BOSS","Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","You never had sex in the office before?","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","No. I once made out with someone but that was it.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Alright so you made out with someone.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Well that's not sex.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Kissing is sex.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Kissing is not sex.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","George?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Jerry.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","No.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","George?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Over here.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","What are you doing here?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","Merry Christmas.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Hide, hide under the desk.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","Ow, ow move over.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Get off of me.","the-red-dot",29
"ELAINE","I've got no room.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","Is that cashmere?","the-red-dot",29
"GEORGE","Of course it's cashmere.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","(noticing the dot) What's this?","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.","the-red-dot",29
"DICK","You mean on the wagon.","the-red-dot",29
"JERRY","Don't get smart.","the-red-dot",29
"THE END"," THE END","the-red-dot",29
"KRAMER","All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch","the-subway",30
"ELAINE","Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?","the-subway",30

"JERRY","That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of","the-subway",30
"GEORGE","What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The","the-subway",30

"JERRY","I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)","the-subway",30
"GEORGE","I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're","the-subway",30

"GEORGE","That guy is not blind.","the-subway",30
"JERRY","So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I","the-subway",30
"GEORGE","I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.","the-subway",30
"JERRY","Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was","the-subway",30
"GEORGE","That's amazing.","the-subway",30

"ELAINE","Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.","the-pez-dispenser",31

"JERRY","What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.","the-pez-dispenser",31
"GEORGE","Wow","the-pez-dispenser",31
"JERRY","Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.","the-pez-dispenser",31
"GEORGE","What's a three letter word for candy?","the-pez-dispenser",31
"JERRY","I can't do those things.","the-pez-dispenser",31
"THE END"," THE END","the-pez-dispenser",31
"JERRY","Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Na.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","It's George.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I think I'll take out the garbage.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Hey, have you ever fasted?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Yeah, right.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Come on, it's just down the hall.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I'll give you 50 cents.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.","the-suicide",32

"GEORGE","It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Hi.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Hi.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","How are you?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","How much do they cost?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","The junior?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","No, no the full size.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","No, no the junior.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","You didn't say ""junior"".","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?","the-suicide",32
"MARTIN","Good enough.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Boy she's sexy isn't she?","the-suicide",32

"ELAINE","What guy?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","My neighbour:","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Oh, that creepy guy?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","He didn't seem too pleased.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","What's so amazing? You've seen him before.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I haven't seen him for months.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","What was the dream?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I think I've played there.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","You're a little paranormal","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Really?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Uh uh, you should go some time.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I'd love to go. Make an appointment.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I just got fired.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Alright, come on, lets get out of here.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Really?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Who is it? Who is it?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","It's Gina.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Who?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Martine's girl friend.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Martine?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","You next door neighbour.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Oh, Martin!","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","What?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Come on.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","In my pajamas? I better get my robe.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","We don't have enough time.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","It'll take two seconds.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","There is no time.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","We don't have two seconds?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","All right. Go ahead.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Nah, forget it.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","No, go ahead.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Will you just get it.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Are you sure?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Forget it. Come on.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Nah, I'll go get the robe.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Really? It's over?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Oh boy, did he say anything about me?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","He said that?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I wasn't.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","You weren't?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Of course.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Tell me everything.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","No, I just wanted to see what time it was.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Are you afraid of him?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","No.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Then kiss me.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Here?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Yes, right here.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Is this the proper venue?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","You don't want to?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Then kiss me right in front of him.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I can't. What if he wakes up?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Hey.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Did you hear about Martin?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Yeah, I heard.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I can't believe he's in a coma.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Who told you about Martin?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Newman! He's good friends with him.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","He's got all of my attachments, you know.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","So what's going on between you and Gina?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Uh, uh.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Nothing.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Why would he come to George?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.","the-suicide",32
"OUT OF YOUR NOSE."," OUT OF YOUR NOSE.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","I knew it. I always felt different.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","You are. Some coffee cake?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Drakes?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Yes.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Did you buy this for me?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","No, why?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Maybe I did.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Take it away.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","She hasn't eaten in two days.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Who's Pauline?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Do you think about her?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","When I hear her name mentioned.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Cut these with your left hand.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Not in this life.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Should you be smoking?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Does it bother you?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","You're pregnant.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Elaine.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","I smoked when I had Faisy.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Ah oh.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","I don't know about this trip George.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Should I not go on this trip?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Elaine, what are you doing?","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","It's disgusting.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Get the hell out.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.","the-suicide",32
"RULA","Get out.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Who are these Stooges you speak of?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","They're a comedy team.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Tell me about them. Everything.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","You will show me The Stooges?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I will show you The Stooges.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","When?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Come, you walk me to a cab.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.","the-suicide",32
"GINA","You're still afraid. You are not a man.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?","the-suicide",32
"GINA","Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Yeah, all right. All right.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","You should just eat fruit.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","I can't eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","???","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Hello Newman.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Boy, it's a good thing we came.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.","the-suicide",32
"NURSE","We'll call you.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","How come?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Looters.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","She's really hungry.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-suicide",32
"ELAINE","Kramer","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","You're not going?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","No.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Why not?","the-suicide",32
"GEORGE","The psychic said something terrible will happen.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I dig.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me.","the-suicide",32
"W","He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't you just buy another one.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?","the-suicide",32
"W","I have a carpet sweeper you can use.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything.","the-suicide",32
"W","It gets my rug clean.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.","the-suicide",32
"W","Well, you should take a look at my rug then.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","I wouldn't set foot in your house.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Hello.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Hello Jerry.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","How's he doing?","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","He looks happy to me.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Why wouldn't he?","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","No reason.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","I'll bring him up to date.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","How up to date?","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Oh, all the way up.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","And nothing could change your mind?","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.","the-suicide",32
"KRAMER","Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","I don't care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","Drake's Coffee Cake","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Wow, where did you get that?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","From my house. I got a whole box of them.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Boy, that's the full size.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","That's your big boy.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Can I have a bite?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","Just one bite?","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile.","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","All right! All right. I won't say anything.","the-suicide",32
"JERRY","You swear?","the-suicide",32
"NEWMAN","I swear.","the-suicide",32

"GEORGE","No, I won't.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Yeah, maybe you won't.","the-fix-up",33
"GEORGE","I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Are my nostrils getting bigger?","the-fix-up",33
"GEORGE","No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","There's just no men out there, you know?","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","I know.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","I hate the good ones.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","Is Jerry one of the good ones?","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to","the-fix-up",33
"GEORGE","I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Oh, so there's still hope.","the-fix-up",33

"ELAINE","Well, at least you're not bitter.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","Who says I'm not bitter?","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","Aren't you too young to be bitter?","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.","the-fix-up",33
"CYNTHIA","Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.","the-fix-up",33

"ELAINE","Went out with Cynthia.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","How was it? What'd you talk about?","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","George too.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Yeah, right.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","I've never fixed anybody up.","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Well you implied it.","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","I didn't say it.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","Who is he?","the-fix-up",33

"JERRY","I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","I went out with you.","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,","the-fix-up",33
"JERRY","Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run","the-fix-up",33
"ELAINE","He can really do that?","the-fix-up",33

"GEORGE","Well the guy's just standing there.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","How would we do it?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien.""","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Maybe he knows O'Brien?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a","the-limo",36
"JERRY","What if we get caught?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.","the-limo",36

"JERRY","She happy for you?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Can he hear us?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","No. Why?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","He can't hear us.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you","the-limo",36
"CHAUFFER","Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.","the-limo",36

"JERRY","I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait,","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I","the-limo",36
"CHAUFFER","I know.","the-limo",36
"JERRY AND GEORGE","He knows?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Maybe it's a shortcut.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?","the-limo",36
"CHAUFFER","Pick up the other members of your party.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other","the-limo",36
"JERRY","It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","It was a good jig.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Well you should have been O'Brien.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Yes, you have to be Murphy.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","You're Murphy!","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I'm Seinfeld!","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.","the-limo",36

"GEORGE","So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Who are you, Mannix?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","We're slowing down. Are those the people?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.","the-limo",36
"WOMAN","Mr. O'Brien?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.","the-limo",36
"EVA","Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Newsletter?","the-limo",36
"TIM","And of course, his great book, ""The Game"".","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never","the-limo",36
"EVA","No.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Never seen a picture of him?","the-limo",36
"EVA","Never.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Not even on the book jacket?","the-limo",36
"EVA","There was no picture on the book jacket.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Hello. I'm O'Brien.","the-limo",36

"ELAINE","I'm not telling you.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","C'mon.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","No!","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","I'll tell you how much I make.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","You ever seen Michael Jordan?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Just in those commercials.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What's that?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.","the-limo",36
"TIM","You think someone's been tipped off?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?","the-limo",36
"EVA","Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman","the-limo",36
"EVA","Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.","the-limo",36
"TIM","Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","He tends to exaggerate.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Okay, I mean it's serious but--","the-limo",36
"EVA","We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Uh, my speech?","the-limo",36
"EVA","Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Well you might as well look it over.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","So what's going on, how did all this happen?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","He did.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","I don't know.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied","the-limo",36
"JERRY","You're not going to open with that, are you?","the-limo",36
"EVA","What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I said so many things.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","They're shooting! They're shooting!","the-limo",36
"TIM","Alright, get down!","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.","the-limo",36
"EVA","But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.","the-limo",36
"TIM","Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Nice looking Lugar.","the-limo",36
"JODI","I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry.","the-limo",36
"DAN","Elaine?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?","the-limo",36
"DAN","Good.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.","the-limo",36
"DAN","Oh, Kramer?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What's going on?","the-limo",36
"DAN","Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.","the-limo",36
"DAN","Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.","the-limo",36
"DAN","Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Who?","the-limo",36
"DAN","The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","What's taking him so long out there?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Didja see the way she was looking at me?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Let's just make a run for it.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","How'd that happen?","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The","the-limo",36
"TIM","We'll be ready in a minute.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle","the-limo",36
"TIM","With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?","the-limo",36
"TIM","You are.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular","the-limo",36
"TIM","You are.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Good. I think you forgot something.","the-limo",36
"TIM","I'm sorry.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Good. Now get out.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Okay, what are we gonna do?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","I'm sure he was just joking around.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What is it?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry,","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Jerry's a nazi?!","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","I can't believe I didn't see it.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","You don't think so.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","No, he's just neat.","the-limo",36
"TIM","You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Me??","the-limo",36
"TIM","And you really don't look like a Murphy.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.","the-limo",36
"TIM","Where are you from?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen.","the-limo",36
"TIM","Sounds more like Scottish.","the-limo",36
"JERRY","We were right on the border.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Maybe he's with the company.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What about his comedy act?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","What about George?","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","I'll bet they were even in on it.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Kramer, you're hurting me!","the-limo",36
"GEORGE","Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Get off of me!!","the-limo",36

"KRAMER","O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?","the-limo",36
"TIM","Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?","the-limo",36
"JERRY","No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","It could be very confusing.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","Yeah? Eva?","the-limo",36
"EVA","It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.","the-limo",36
"KRAMER","O'Brien? Well that's weird.","the-limo",36
"EVA","Who are you?","the-limo",36
"JODI","A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of","the-limo",36
"JODI","They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem","the-limo",36

"ELAINE","Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!","the-limo",36
"DAN","Elaine?","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-limo",36

"THE END"," THE END","the-limo",36
"ELAINE","You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh look at this guy.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What's goin' on?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Did you get a thank you wave?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Give me that wave!","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Jerry, are you free on Friday?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Yeah, I'm free, why?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","You gotta follow that car!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","What?!","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","You can't let him get away with that!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What are you, yellow?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Wait, he stopped, he's parking.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Let's not even analyze it.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","So you didn't turn her in?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.","the-good-samaritan",37

"GEORGE","Hey, hey, hey! I dig.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh, you dig?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Yes! I see enormous potential here.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Why?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","I don't think so.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","What am I drinking, milk?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Hi.","the-good-samaritan",37

"ELAINE","Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Yeah, Queens.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","So? Then what?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary.""","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","I am speechless. I am without speech.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Tell her about the shoving.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","What?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What shoving?!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh, it was nothing.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","No! Tell her.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","You know karate??","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I know a little.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Hey! (Group does likewise)","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Did you tell Kramer?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","What? What? What? Tell me.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","They should be sent to Australia.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Australia?","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","But not any more.","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","No.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Hey Kramer, Kramer!","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Yeah?","the-good-samaritan",37

"KRAMER","I don't know!","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I","the-good-samaritan",37

"ELAINE","But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","We just met.","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","But I, I can't go alone!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Ask George to go with you.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","George, come on! I'll pay for you.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","You'll pay? I'm there.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Why do you even need anybody?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","You went out with a bullfighter?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.","the-good-samaritan",37

"WOMAN","Come here.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Really, I was, I was only kidding around.","the-good-samaritan",37

"MICHAEL","You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","He was only joking Michael! Sorry.","the-good-samaritan",37

"ELAINE","It's me.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","What if she's having an off night?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Hi!","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!","the-good-samaritan",37

"GEORGE","Ah, shut up.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","A stupid what?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Whatever.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze,","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Who?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Robin!","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Why?!","the-good-samaritan",37

"KRAMER","Mary Hart!","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","God.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","What?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Get together?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Maybe she just wants to talk to me?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Are you actually considering this?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!","the-good-samaritan",37
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-good-samaritan",37
"KRAMER","Hey, you know who owns that car?","the-good-samaritan",37

"KRAMER","Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","The blond with the blue sweatpants!","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Well, who is she?","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","You can't compromise your principles!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","How am I going to live with myself?!","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Can't live!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","This country needs more people like you!","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","I believe strongly in that as you know.","the-good-samaritan",37
"JERRY","There should be more people like us.","the-good-samaritan",37

"GEORGE","Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","Oh no, what's wrong?","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","You didn't commit adultery, I did.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Oh yeah.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.","the-good-samaritan",37
"GEORGE","Well, that's a given.","the-good-samaritan",37
"ROBIN","In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.","the-good-samaritan",37

"MIKE","Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Oh, come on.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","You've got a prayer.","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","I go in front first all the time.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Did you talk to him?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's all taken care of.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","You told him? What did you tell him?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","I don't believe it, what did you say?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","A pack of teenagers?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","You are a genius, it's as simple as that.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","What?","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Oh great.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","I didn't know.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","A flea market? You went to a flea market??","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Hey, who's talking to you?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","We just didn't think of you.","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","You said it, sister.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","You're right. My fault.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Yeah, I'm sorry.","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","It was a so-so sorry.","the-parking-space",39
"TRUCK DRIVER","Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?","the-parking-space",39
"TRUCK DRIVER","Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through,","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Wild pack of teenagers, huh?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Uh huh.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Right.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","I learned a lot about myself.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","What did you do to my car?!","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","I thought you said you were a good driver!","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","I think you said driver.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Will you move it up a little bit?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","No no no, that's in the right position.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","No no, I was further in.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Do you mind?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Do you?","the-parking-space",39
"SID","Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Hey Sid.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Who are you?","the-parking-space",39
"SID","Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Sid, it's completely his fault.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Oh, right.","the-parking-space",39
"SID","Why don't you start taking the bus?","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Don't do it!","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Why don't you just flip a coin already?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","So you're against me now?","the-parking-space",39
"ANGRY MAN","He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go","the-parking-space",39
"MATTHEW","No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.","the-parking-space",39
"ANGRY MAN","No he wasn't.","the-parking-space",39
"MATTHEW","All that matters is who was there first.","the-parking-space",39
"ANGRY MAN","Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.","the-parking-space",39
"MATTHEW","You just spit on me!","the-parking-space",39

"MATTHEW","No.","the-parking-space",39
"MARYEDITH","Come on, Matthew!","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","I thought she was pregnant.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Hey, do you think I'm phony?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","What?","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Mike thinks I'm a phony.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","He thinks you're a phony?","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Oh, you have to say something.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","You gotta open the vault.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Open my vault?","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","Open your vault.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","You have no choice.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Oy ga-vault.","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","When can you park head first?","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","Never.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","What are you asking this guy for?","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","Who's talking to you?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","He's right. never.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.","the-parking-space",39

"KRAMER","What about Sundays and holidays?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Oh please.","the-parking-space",39
"SHEILA","What's going on here?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.","the-parking-space",39

"GEORGE","You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There!","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Alright, just keep the hat!","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs,","the-parking-space",39
"ELAINE","It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","I'm not going if he's going.","the-parking-space",39
"NEWMAN","Me either.","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","I'm not going if he's going.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Well I'm going.","the-parking-space",39

"JERRY","Why? I'll tell you why.","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","No. Don't, Jerry.","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Like you didn't call me a phony?","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Use it in a sentence.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?","the-parking-space",39
"KRAMER","He begged me.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","He begged you?!","the-parking-space",39
"JERRY","Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Officer, could I just explain something to you?","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Officer, he can't pull in head first.","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was","the-parking-space",39
"GEORGE","Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!","the-parking-space",39
"MIKE","Well, you're gonna have to go to work!","the-parking-space",39

"OPENING SCENE","Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Kramer, what are you doing here!?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","You scared me!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","It's just me.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","That's enough!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","C'mon...c'mon...","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Kramer! What are you doing?!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","What does it look like I'm doing? What?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Alright, alright...","the-keys",40
"JERRY","C'mon!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Sorry.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Move it! Move it! Get going!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Is that my towel?","the-keys",40
"GIRLFRIEND","I'm really happy the movie was sold out.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?","the-keys",40
"GIRLFRIEND","I'm from Witchita, so...","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)","the-keys",40
"GIRLFRIEND","Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)","the-keys",40
"GIRLFRIEND","That was close!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Did you see the look on that guy's face?","the-keys",40
"GIRLFRIEND","You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","What?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, come on!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","No, come on!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","What, what, I thought you went to the movies!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","It was sold out!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","That's the point.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","What point?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Just, look, just give the keys.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Just give me another chance!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Don't ask me!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I'm asking you!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I'm telling you.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","You're joking.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I'm serious!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","It's not going to happen again!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Yes it will, now give me those keys!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","So put 'em in a safe place.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I will.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Where?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I can't.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Who's there?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Oh, I'm not, uh...","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of the keys.""","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Jerry, give him the keys back.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine...","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Take the keys.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","O.K.!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Your spare set?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","That's right.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","You want 'em back?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Well, you can get 'em back.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","I suppose I could.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Me?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)","the-keys",40
"WAITRESS","Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Do you ever yearn?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yearn? Do I yearn?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I yearn.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","You yearn.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Look at you.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Aw, Kramer, don't start...","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","You're wasting your life.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","You got money?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Do you have a woman?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Do you have any prospects?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","You got anything on the horizon?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Uh...no.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Do you have any action at all?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","I like to get the Daily News!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Why?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one line! You got fired!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Uh, no, I'm not.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","You're not really gonna go to California, are you?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother.""","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","That's ridiculous.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","That's Kramer.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","What for?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Jerry? Why?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","'Cause he gave me his.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","So what?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","So, if he has my keys, I should have his.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I just said the same thing to you.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","What?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","What?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Did you bring the keys?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","This could be an emergency!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","You never should have taken away his keys!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","How'd the Mets do?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","They lost.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Kramer?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Hello, boys.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Hello, Newman.","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","You lookin' for someone?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Coy? I'm not being coy.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Is he being coy?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yeah, coy.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Who?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Turn around, George.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Sure. (Turns around.)","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","George?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Help! Help!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Where's Kramer?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","HELP! (Elaine enters.)","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","What's going on?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","They're gonna beat me up!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","No we're not.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Bad rap?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","Yeah. From you.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Me?","the-keys",40
"NEWMAN","You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","L.A.?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullsh*t.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Huh?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","What...?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","No, what'd you say?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Nothing. I didn't say anything.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Oh, you didn't see it.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I heard you say something, there.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I didn't say anything.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Ask her about Kramer.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","She's drunk out of her mind.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Hey! You ever been in an accident?","the-keys",40
"BIKER","About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Don't feel right? What are you talking about?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What is the big deal?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Nope, no can do.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Do you wanna fight?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Do you wanna fight?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, he's cold.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What's that?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Nothing.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I heard something.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","So, how long you been drivin' this thing?","the-keys",40
"WOMAN","Goin' on four years.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.","the-keys",40
"WOMAN","Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.","the-keys",40
"WOMAN","You want to give it a try?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Really?","the-keys",40
"WOMAN","Do you know how to double-clutch?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-keys",40
"WOMAN","Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Well, this is great.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Well, what do they look like?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) ""What do they look like.""","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Well, they're obviously not here.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What is this? ""Murphy Brown""?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","What?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","By Elaine Benes?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","What?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Gimme half!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","All right, here!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Why didn't she tell us?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","You weasels!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What? What?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","How dare you!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","We hardly read anything!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","It was funny!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Well, it's just a first draft!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","He forced me to!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I did not!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Yes you did!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","You! Get out! Get out! Get out!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Good!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","And I want my keys back from you!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","What, you don't want me to hold your keys?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","No, you can't be trusted!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)","the-keys",40
"JERRY","And I don't want you to hold mine!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Good! I won't!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Good! Don't! Are these my keys?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","These aren't my keys!","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Whose are these?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I don't know!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I just thought I could write it.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Is that something you want to do?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","What did you say?","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","I didn't say anything.","the-keys",40
"JERRY","I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!","the-keys",40
"ELAINE","Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!","the-keys",40
"JERRY","Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!","the-keys",40
"CANDICE BERGEN","Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.","the-keys",40
"CANDICE BERGEN","And you are...?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.","the-keys",40
"CANDICE BERGEN","Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Steven.","the-keys",40
"CANDICE BERGEN","Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?","the-keys",40
"KRAMER","Oh - I'm familiar with it.","the-keys",40
"CANDICE BERGEN","Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you.","the-keys",40
"THE END"," THE END","the-keys",40
"GEORGE","Kramer was on Murphy Brown?","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","Are you sure?","the-trip-part-1",41

"GEORGE","With Candace Bergen!","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","I know!","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","Sure.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","Did she show her breasts in that?","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","She's not really the naked type.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","He did?","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","Yeah, I turned him down.","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","How come you didn't tell me?","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","He asked me to keep it a secret.","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","But you can never keep a secret.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","Well, you've come a long way.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","I've matured.","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","A free ticket?","the-trip-part-1",41

"GEORGE","What about accommodations?","the-trip-part-1",41
"JERRY","All taken care of.","the-trip-part-1",41
"GEORGE","Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have","the-trip-part-1",41

"STUDIO GUARD","Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?","the-trip-part-1",41

"KRAMER","Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.","the-trip-part-1",41

"HELENA","Hello Kramer.","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Well, that's only uh, 58 years.","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","It was a Three Stooges short, ""Sappy Pappy."" I played Mr. Sugarman's","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Uh huh, right.","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Right.","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","Moe hits Curly with an axe,","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Uh huh.","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","The Stooges catch the kidnappers,","the-trip-part-1",41

"HELENA","The baby's dead.","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Really?","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.","the-trip-part-1",41

"HELENA","Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENA","Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very","the-trip-part-1",41
"HELENE","Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll","the-trip-part-1",41
"KRAMER","Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.","the-trip-part-1",41

"JERRY","What?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","This. Just talking.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","(dismissing) Yeah, right.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Just talking? Well what's the show about?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","It's about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No story?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No forget the story.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You've got to have a story.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for,","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","And who is on the show? Who are the characters?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I could be a character.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah. You could base a character on me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, ""You know you're a quite a character.""","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","And who else is on the show?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Elaine could be a character. Kramer..","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Right.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","And it's about nothing?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Absolutely nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","We go into NBC.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","""We""? Since when are you a writer?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You want to go with me to NBC?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah. I think we really go something here.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What do we got?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","An idea.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What idea?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","An idea for the show.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I still don't know what the idea is.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","It's about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Right.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Exactly.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","They say, ""What's your show about?"" I say, ""Nothing.""","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","There you go.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","(Nodding) I think you may have something there.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","(Thinks) No, I don't think so.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What do you mean you don't think so?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","I don't like it.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I don't understand. What don't you like about it?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","I don't like the idea of a character based on me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Why not?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","well it just doesn't sit well.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","That's your problem, buddy.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I don't understand what the big deal is.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Whatever you want.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","I get to play Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You can't play Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","I am Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","But you can't act.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Phew!","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Newman?","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","Use me for what?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Nothin' What do you want?","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Yeah. That's strange.","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","That's queer uh?","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.","the-pitch",43
"THAT TICKET."," THAT TICKET.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Buyer beware.","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","No, but there's karma, Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Karma Kramer?","the-pitch",43
"NEWMAN","And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Nervous) Nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","You sure? You look a little pale.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What, are you nervous?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","This was your idea!","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I told you not to come.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I need some water. I gotta get some water.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","They'll give us water in there.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Really? That's pretty good.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh God, it's Joe Devola.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Who?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh God he saw me.","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","Hello Jerry.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","You're under no obligation to shake my hand.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","Why shouldn't I look good?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","You want to hit me?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What are you doing here?","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","I dreopped a script off.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","AH, GOOD FOR YOU.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, ...","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","You don't have to say anything.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","Why?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Kramer's party.","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.","the-pitch",43
"DEVOLA","Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Give my best to Hinckley.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","What was that?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...","the-pitch",43
"RECEPTIONIST","They're ready for you.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Relax. Who are they?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah, they're not better than me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Course not.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Who are they?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","They're nobody.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","What about me?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What about you?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Why them? Why not me?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Why not you?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I'm as good as them.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Better.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","You really think so?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No.","the-pitch",43
"STU","(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Yeah, it's one of my favorites.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, ""La Cocina."" ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Pepe.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.","the-pitch",43
"SUSANEWMAN","Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","So, what have you two come up with?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Interrupting) May I?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Go ahead.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","Nothing?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Smiling) Nothing.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","(Unimpressed) What does that mean?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","The show is about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.","the-pitch",43
"RECEPTIONIST","Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","I'll call back.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Is it with a ""y""?","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","No.","the-pitch",43
"SUSANEWMAN","What's the premise?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","You read? You read on the show?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Oh, no. No stories.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","No stories? So, what is it?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(Showing an example) What'd you do today?","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","I got up and came to work.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","There's a show. That's a show.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","(Confused) How is that a show?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No, no, no. Nothing happens.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, something happens.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","Well, why am I watching it?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Because it's on TV.","the-pitch",43
"RUSSELL","(Threatening) Not yet.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","(To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE",". . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Wait a minute let me call Susan.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No, no this is more important.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","She might be leaving to work any minute.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","No.","the-pitch",43
"ELAINE","What is it?","the-pitch",43
"DR. RESTON","I was just thinking about this patient of mine.","the-pitch",43
"ELAINE","What?","the-pitch",43
"DR. RESTON","Just wondering if he's taking his medication.","the-pitch",43
"ELAINE","Well, come on we're on vacation.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Yeah (to buzzer)","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","(OC) It's George.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Whoa, back up a second.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Why would you think I would invite him?","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I just a ssumed, ...","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Of course. How are you?","the-pitch",43
"SUSAN","Fine, it's good to see you.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","And this is Kramer.","the-pitch",43
"SUSAN","Hello.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","All right go ahead Susan, tell him.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Tell me what?","the-pitch",43
"SUSAN","Well, I, (phone rings)","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.","the-pitch",43
"TEL","Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.","the-pitch",43
"TEL","Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.","the-pitch",43
"TEL","No.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Well, go ahead, tell him.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Kramer, are you drinking that milk?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What's the expiration date on that?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","September third.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","The third?","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","and SUSAN: The third?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Um, Uh, ugh, ...","the-pitch",43
"SUSAN","Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","I think SHE saw it coming.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What happened to you?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Devola came after me.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your party.""","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Boy,that is some kick.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Wow, Newman's helmet.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Holly.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Me, why?","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","He doesn't like you.","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.","the-pitch",43
"KRAMER","Pass the cream.","the-pitch",43
"GEORGE","Wait a second. (smells it). all right.","the-pitch",43
"THE END"," THE END","the-pitch",43
"JERRY","Where the hell did I put this?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","What are you looking for?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","No, no, no.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","All right, what is this?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","what is what?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","All right, very funny. I get it.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","You're in a weird mood.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Fix what?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Your pants!","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Go look at your face in the mirror.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Wha-huh-wha-huh...","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","yeah?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","It's George.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","I don't believe this.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","No, I swear.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Me?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Yeah, here you go.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","What's this?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","A dry-cleaning bill?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","From that woman at NBC?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","A dry-cleaning bill for what?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","For vomiting on her vest!","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Yeah, your milk.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","He drank it.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","I didn't know.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","How much was it to clean the vest?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Eighteen dollars.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Can you get vomit out of suede?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Yo-yo Ma!","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","What? Yo-yo Ma?","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","What about him?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","What's Yo-yo Ma?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","I know!","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.","the-ticket",44
"KRAMER","Jeez!","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","Anyway.","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today.","the-ticket",44
"GEORGE","What?","the-ticket",44
"JERRY","NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.","the-ticket",44

"JUDGE","I don't understand.","the-ticket",44
"NEWMAN","You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank.

"KRAMER","Yo-yo Ma!","the-ticket",44

"ELAINE","He was my psychiatrist, you know. He knows all my patterns. In my relationships I always try to find some reason to leave, so as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.","the-wallet",45
"GEORGE","What do you mean - ""Not letting you?""","the-wallet",45

"ELAINE","No, it's not going to work with this guy.","the-wallet",45
"GEORGE","Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your life.","the-wallet",45

"JERRY","She hasn't told her father yet?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Susan wants me to be there.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","You're meetin' the father for the first time?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Reluctantly) Yeah.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Yeah, I know what happened.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Getting frustrated) I know.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","What, you got a problem with the pen now?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I,","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Offering) Drink?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","No, no thank you.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Act I, Scene A..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up)","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Alright, here we go. You got it?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Here we go.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","Why? Did Jerry say something?","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","No, no.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","He must have said something.","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Oh, no, he didn't say anything.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","(Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Alright, let's go.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Here we go.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Complaining) No more golf.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Why?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Why? What's one thing got to do with another?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Kramer, please.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it,","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","What?!","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","(Gruff) A slight resemblance.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","You know those cigars are made special for Castro?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","What?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","I didn't care much for his jokes.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","(To George) Daddy never laughs.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","You and your cigars..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Uhh.. about the cabin..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","What?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Daddy..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","Yes?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Daddy, about the cabin..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","(To Susan) What about it?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Well, the thing is..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","What? What is it?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Extremely blunt) Burned.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","Burned?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","There was a fire, and it uh..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Burned.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)","the-cheever-letters",48
"MR. ROSS","Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SUSAN","(Solemn) No. Nothing.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MRS. ROSS","(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","(Offended) I can't believe you said that!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","What?!","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","That was a weird thing to say.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","Ohh, I think you're really sick.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","I really think you're making too much of this.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Let me walk you to a cab.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","(Opens the door) That's ok.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SANDRA","Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Wo-hoah! What did you do?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Yeah, right.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Alright, so, go ahead.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","So we go back to my apartment..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Typical things.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","..And then she starts talking about her panties.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","So I said something.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Ok, what did you say?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Of course.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?""","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) ""The panties your mother laid out for you""? (Jerry nods) What","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Well, how did she react?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","She flipped out! Just left.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check)","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","I guess he failed to see the humor in it.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Huh. (Makes a ""over his head"" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Getting up) Alright, big work day.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","That's right.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Okay.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Let's go.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Here we are.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Right now.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Let's do it.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","You and me.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Okay.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Alright.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","What'dya got?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go ""Hi"", and I go, ""Hello."" Now.. we need something here..","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Oh, hey.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Don't be silly.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Come in, we're taking a break.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yeah!","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Buenos dias.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SECRETARY","Buenos dias.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Uh, habla ingles?","the-cheever-letters",48
"SECRETARY","Si.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SECRETARY","What is this about?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SECRETARY","Are you an American?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah.","the-cheever-letters",48
"SECRETARY","I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone)","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Okay.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","It's Elaine.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?","the-cheever-letters",48
"GEORGE","No, no, no, no.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Oh.","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","What?","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Why? What happened? Did you talk?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Really?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Yes.","the-cheever-letters",48
"ELAINE","Really? You really think I should fire her?","the-cheever-letters",48
"JERRY","Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","(To secretary) Expira te afuera.","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","What is your name, Senor?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Uh, Kramer.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","(Confused) Cigars?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Definite) Cigars.","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","What about cigars?","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..","the-cheever-letters",48
"MAN","Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..","the-cheever-letters",48
"KRAMER","(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?","the-cheever-letters",48

"GEORGE","Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","So we'll do it tomorrow.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","About six years ago.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Women like skiers.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Yeah. Right.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","The closet business? What's the closet business?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What is it your business?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I'm interested.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Yeah. So what happened?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","George, Marla.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Marla.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","George. Jerry, Stacey.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Stacey.","the-virgin",50
"STACEY","Jerry.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","George, Stacey.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Stacey.","the-virgin",50
"STACEY","George.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","George.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","So, how was your trip to Berlin?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Trip to Berlin?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, right, right.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?""","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","You, know my boyfriend went.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Really?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, did he like it?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.","the-virgin",50
"STACEY","Wow, what a great job. A writer.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Not a bad way to make a buck.","the-virgin",50
"STACEY","Sounds great.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So, are you gonna go out with her?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I might.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What about Susan?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Depends.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Depends on what?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","On many factors.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Like what?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Implied.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","She got anything in your medicine cabinet?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","There might be some moisturizer.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","(Pause) Yeah.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You got yourself a girlfriend.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You're going to make a good father someday.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","No, what?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Why? What do you mean?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Oh, right. Oh no, man.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","This is your plan?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","No, no. I'm just thinking.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I don't think you are.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Let me tell you what I think.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Are you very fussy about your pants?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I don't think I am.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Try me.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Everything?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","No.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","What?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","This is not a good time.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Five minutes. What?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What did you have to give your TV away to George for?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Well, wow.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Marla, Kramer.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Why don't you go out? It's nice out.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","There's weather.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Will you tape it?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Kramer... (points to Marla)","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Yeah. (He exits)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Never came back.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","It's me.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","I didn't get it.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well, he wanted me to move in with him.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Snapple?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","No thanks.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Go on.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well I wouldn't move in because...","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yes.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well because...","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Hello!","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","I should be going.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","No, no, I'm leaving.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I like that thing in your hair there.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","No thanks.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","I should be going.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So we'll talk about the hooks then?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Yes. (She exits)","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","What? Was it something I said?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","She's a virgin, she just told me.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Well I didn't know.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Well it's not like spotting a toupee.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","No, no, I mean...","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","It's George.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","She's a virgin?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","A virgin.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Wow. So what're you gonna do?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah, me too.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","I'm in. Let's go for it.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What do you want?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","I don't care, whatever.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Okay. What are you getting?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","What's a Chow Fung?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","It's a broad noodle.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","What do you mean, a broad noodle?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","It's a big flat noodle.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Well I don't want a big flat noodle.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What kind of noodle do you want?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Who says I want a noodle?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Fine.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Get extra MSG.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","So they just leave?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Eh.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Where's the food? What happened to Ping?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Your butler?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What about me?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","There was a bit of an accident.","the-virgin",50
"PING","Head hurts. Head really hurts.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What happened?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Something happened to the food?","the-virgin",50
"PING","I only saved one bag.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","I'll get some ice.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Hey, you got the food?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah, here.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","What took you so long? Hey, Ping!","the-virgin",50
"PING","Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Yeah. Where's yours?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","He dropped it.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Oh, that's too bad.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.","the-virgin",50
"PING","No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.","the-virgin",50
"TV."," TV.","the-virgin",50
"PING","(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.","the-virgin",50
"PING","(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What do you mean? They know we're here.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","No, no, would you get up?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I can do this, Jerry.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","No.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)","the-virgin",50
"WOMAN","Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.","the-virgin",50
"RITA","Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?","the-virgin",50
"RITA","He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)","the-virgin",50
"RITA","Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","David Letterman's on the floor?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah, he just walked by.","the-virgin",50
"RITA","Well, I think we should get started anyway.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Yeah, good idea.","the-virgin",50
"RITA","So how are you guys comin' along?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.","the-virgin",50
"RITA","Good. (Pause)","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?","the-virgin",50
"RITA","So that's the idea?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?","the-virgin",50
"RITA","I'm Rita Kearson.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Would you give him the TV back?","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","Hello?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Fired? Why?","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","But I had no... I didn't realize.","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","I just feel terrible This is just terrible.","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.","the-virgin",50
"SUSAN","I'll speak to you later.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Why did he fire her?","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!","the-virgin",50
"KRAMER","What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Another job?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Couple of interviews.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What? Leave? Where? Why?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","You know, the apartment.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Why would I leave? This is my apartment.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well what if it was my apartment?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.","the-virgin",50
"MARLA","Maybe I should get going.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What else did you say to her?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","I was trying to be.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.","the-virgin",50
"ELAINE","Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.","the-virgin",50
"GEORGE","What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.","the-virgin",50
"WOMAN","A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.","the-virgin",50
"CAROL","A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)","the-virgin",50
"WOMAN","A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!","the-virgin",50
"THE END"," THE END","the-virgin",50
"JERRY","(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","Mm-hm.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.","the-contest",51

"KRAMER","Hey, Georgie.","the-contest",51
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Hi.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","(To George) What's the matter?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","""Caught"" you? Doing what?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","(Nods) Uh-huh.","the-contest",51
"KRAMER","(Laughing) She caught you?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Where?","the-contest",51

"JERRY","""Glamour""?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","..So, one thing lead to another..","the-contest",51
"JERRY","So, what did she do?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.","the-contest",51
"KRMAER","(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","What did you do?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","I zipped up!","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","No, I guess you couldn't have..","the-contest",51
"JERRY","(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Finishing it off) ..done that.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Between chuckles) How is she?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","It's not funny, Elaine.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's","the-contest",51
"JERRY","""Glamour""?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.","the-contest",51

"JERRY AND ELAINE","C'mon..","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","You don't think I can?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","No chance.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","(Daring) You think you could?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Care to make it interesting?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Sure, how much?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","A hundred dollars.","the-contest",51

"KRAMER","(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)","the-contest",51
"JERRY","You?","the-contest",51

"ELAINE","What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Because you're a woman!","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","So what?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Sarcastic) Oh.","the-contest",51

"KRAMER","..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)","the-contest",51

"GEORGE","""Quite a workout""? What did you say?","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Smiling, proud) I said, ""yeah.""","the-contest",51
"JERRY","(Adding, fake praise) Good one.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and","the-contest",51

"GEORGE","You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?","the-contest",51

"JERRY","But you made it through the day before.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Why outside here?","the-contest",51

"JERRY","Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..","the-contest",51
"MARLA","Let's go in the bedroom.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Really?","the-contest",51
"MARLA","Yes.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","You sure?","the-contest",51
"MARLA","Yes.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","You really want to?","the-contest",51
"MARLA","I do. I'm ready.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Okay..","the-contest",51
"MARLA","I know how difficult this must have been for you.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.","the-contest",51
"MARLA","What do you mean?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Well, it's kinda silly, but..","the-contest",51
"MARLA","Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?","the-contest",51
"JERRY","No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-","the-contest",51
"MARLA","I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-","the-contest",51
"MARLA","I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.","the-contest",51

"GEORGE","Yeah, he did.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","No, no, no. He just left.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","What?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Yeah, he was talking to Marla.","the-contest",51
"JERRY","Marla?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-contest",51
"ELAINE","They drove away?","the-contest",51
"GEORGE","Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-","the-contest",51

"JERRY","...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ""There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!"".","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Hey, could you do me a favour? (pause) Could you shut-up?They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck and before you can say ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", they collide head-on with a Snapple truck....","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work,","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Gimme ten bucks and find out...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Yeah, worked out good.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","And here's the beauty--","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","What?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","George is pickin' us up at the airport.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Get out of here! Why?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","You know that awning outside my building?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Yeah...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","So what happened?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Hey, how we doin' on time?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Hey! Wait up!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Hey! Wait up!","the-airport",52
"DRIVER","Sorry. Heh heh heh...","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","Where you goin'?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Uh, JFK. (To Elaine) I need some small bills for a tip. You","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Yeah, you want five?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Gimme ten.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","You're giving him *ten* dollars?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Well, we got three bags.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","That's a pretty big tip...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","That's what they get!","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","They don't get that much.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Let's ask him.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","We can't ask him...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Let's see what he says.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Jerry, we don't have time for this...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Two seconds. (To Skycap) Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","Depends on the person, depends on the bag.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Uh, how about a couple of people like us.","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like","the-airport",52
"JERRY","C'mon, seriously...","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","What!?","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","That's right.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","Look, you asked, I told you.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","You're lucky I don't report you...","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","JFK...","the-airport",52
"JFK..."," JFK...","the-airport",52
"SKYCAP","...Honolulu.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Wait up!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man!","the-airport",52
"TICKET LADY","Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats","the-airport",52
"JERRY","We'll take 'em!","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","We're not going to sit together?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","We'll call him...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","There's no time.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","No time? (To ticket lady) Is there time?","the-airport",52
"TLADY","There's no time.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.","the-airport",52
"TLADY","I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","I'll take the first class.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Jerry!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","What?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Why should you get the first class?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Elaine, have you ever flown first class?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","No.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","You flew here coach.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Yeah, that's a point...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Bon voyage, Lainey!","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Great... (To herself) Help me...","the-airport",52

"GEORGE","Hey, thanks for coming with me.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","I confused it with another awning.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","So how we doin' on time?","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway?","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Will you relax?!","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","This is the best way to go!","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Really?","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Duty.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","No, I dunno how much duty is.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","I still like to stop at the duty free shop.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","I like to stop at the duty free shop.","the-airport",52
"TIA","So, he says, ""squeeze your breasts together"", and I say, ""I thought this was an ad for shoes""...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Oh my...","the-airport",52
"TIA","Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you","the-airport",52
"JERRY","What is this an ad for?","the-airport",52
"TIA","See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Uh-huh...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","How does it look on your side? (Pause while George just stares at him) We'll get there...","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... (To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself) Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.","the-airport",52
"GROSSBARD","Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... (He leaves)","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Did you see that guy?","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","No... What guy?","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","That guy.. He was just...","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","(still lost) I know that guy...","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.","the-airport",52
"GUARD","Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","Hey, I was gonna take that!","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!","the-airport",52
"GUARD","All right, let's go...","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","I want the magazine!","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Umm... No.","the-airport",52
"PRISONER","You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Where do I know that guy from?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","(To herself, loudly) Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake*","the-airport",52

"TIA","Please!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","My name is not mentioned in this blurb...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","It's Grossbard!","the-airport",52

"KRAMER","When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month,","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract.","the-airport",52

"ATTENDANT","They're gardenias, mostly.","the-airport",52

"ELAINE","But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","You're not supposed to get up during the food service.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Well, nobody *told* me that!","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve.","the-airport",52

"KRAMER","Gimme your credit card.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","My credit card?","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","I'll try and remember that. (Pause) Where's my meal?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Are you sure?","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Would you?","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Then why didn't you take it?","the-airport",52

"JERRY","More everything!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Super Savers? Are they refundable!?","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","Do you know how much this is going to cost me?","the-airport",52

"ELAINE","Elaine Benes?","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","(Checks her list) You're going to have to go back to coach.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","No, but there was nobody sitting here...","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... (She notices another attendant offering goods)","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","You're going to have to go back to your seat!","the-airport",52
"ELAINE","Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! (She goes through the curtain to,ick, *coach*) Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with.","the-airport",52
"ATTENDANT","Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.","the-airport",52
"KRAMER","Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Couldn't be...","the-airport",52
"JERRY","Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...","the-airport",52

"JERRY","Yeah. Where's George?","the-airport",52
"GEORGE"," GEORGE","the-airport",52
"JERRY","But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby--","the-airport",52
"THE END"," THE END","the-airport",52
"GEORGE","I loved her Jerry, I loved her.","the-pick",53

"GEORGE","Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","You walk around with no underwear?","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?","the-pick",53
"JERRY","I do a wash.","the-pick",53

"GEORGE","I loved her!","the-pick",53
"JERRY","You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","I gotta call her. Should I call her?","the-pick",53
"JERRY","George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?","the-pick",53

"GEORGE","Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me (struggling with his coat zipper) and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?","the-pick",53
"DANA","So uh, she broke up with you? ...","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?","the-pick",53
"DANA","It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","What is with this damn zipper?","the-pick",53
"DANA","It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.","the-pick",53
"DANA","It doesn't matter, so ...","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...","the-pick",53

"ELAINE","Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.","the-pick",53

"ELAINE","(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.","the-pick",53

"ELAINE","That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","Hey!","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","Have you seen the card?","the-pick",53

"ELAINE","Right!!","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","Ooo!","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","No. I don't want him looking.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.","the-pick",53
"NX","Okay. What is it?","the-pick",53

"KRAMER","I got them too.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Everybody's got them.","the-pick",53
"DANA","You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Pull it up a little bit.","the-pick",53
"DANA","Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.","the-pick",53

"ELAINE","(OC) It's me.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Was there any nostril penetration?","the-pick",53
"JERRY","There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","No. That's disgusting!","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... (sees card) Oh please!","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. (rubs George's head on her breasts) Here's your Christmas card.","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","Got any Double Crunch?","the-pick",53
"JERRY","yeah. I think I do.","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","What's that perfume?","the-pick",53
"ELAINE","What, Ocean.","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.","the-pick",53
"KRAMER","I thought you said it was a scratch.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","But that's not what she thinks.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.","the-pick",53
"JERRY","All right. I'll call the agency. (Elaine grabs card from George) Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town.

"GEORGE","It'll be different this time.","the-pick",53
"SUSAN","I need someone a little more stable.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!","the-pick",53
"SUSAN","People don't change.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.","the-pick",53
"SUSAN","I'm not a soft boiled egg.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","And I am not a piece of toast.","the-pick",53
"SUSAN","I just don't think we have anything in common.","the-pick",53
"GEORGE","That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.","the-pick",53
"SUSAN","Why were there so many cockroaches?","the-pick",53

"CHERYL","Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","No, no, you can't do that,","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","No! No.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","You know we should really order, the service is so slow","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.","the-visa",55

"GEORGE","What are you doing? What are you doing?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","This is not good. This is not good.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What's the matter?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Why not?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Biff?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","What?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","You're not worried about that?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","No, of course not.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well, should we leave?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I don't have to be funny, I don't care.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","You don't?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","No way! It's completely under my control.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Of course I can, am I being funny now?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","A little.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","George, is this funny?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","What? What did I do?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Hi.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Hello. Welcome back.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Well, nobody likes to get old, right?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Funny guy, huh?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well thank you very much, it's about time.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, the camp ended a few days early.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Why?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Uh, well there was an incident.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What happened?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","You punched who in the mouth?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Mickey Mantle.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What happened?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching,","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Wow! Joe Pepitone!","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I","the-visa",55

"KRAMER","Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Wow, this is incredible!","the-visa",55
"BABU","Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What's going on out there?","the-visa",55
"BABU","What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Yeah, so?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","So what'd you do?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, I got the hell out of there.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","They took Babu away!","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","They took Babu away?!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu,","the-visa",55
"BABU","Jerry! Jerry! Help me!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Uh oh.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","What?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well this is interesting.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","What is it?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, doesn't he need that?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Yeah, so am I being funny now?","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","No, actually, you're not being funny now.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Ah, will you stop it already?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Jerry, please?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","How long is this gonna go on?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Till I'm comfortable.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well, when is that gonna be?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","After consummation.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a","the-visa",55
"JERRY","That's wonderful news. Thank you.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","You're a very serious person, aren't you?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","I understand.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","I think it's curdled.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I don't care.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","Do you ever laugh?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","That's so sad. What do you do?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Hey, we're gonna go see Babu","the-visa",55

"CHERYL","Hi.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","You're kidding.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","No, I'm not.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Babu!","the-visa",55

"BABU","So nice of you both to come.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Oh, Babu.","the-visa",55
"BABU","No no, you're both very kind, very kind.","the-visa",55
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Oh, well, you know.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","We try.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","We do what we can.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","We do what we can.","the-visa",55

"BABU","Come again?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.","the-visa",55
"BABU","You had my Visa application?!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well not technically.","the-visa",55
"BABU","I kill you!!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well what about her?","the-visa",55
"BABU","I kill both of you!!","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Babu?!","the-visa",55

"GEORGE","Jerry?","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","I'm very attracted to him.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","He never said anything funny.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","He can't not be funny.","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","I gotta go.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Well, should I call you later?","the-visa",55
"CHERYL","Please don't.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","It's George.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","C'mon up.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Babu must be back.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Where's Babu?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Who are you?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Snapple?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","She didn't help him?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","No.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Where is he?","the-visa",55
"JERRY","He's in Pakistan.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Oh boy.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","What do you mean, oh boy?","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","That's because she had my mail.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.","the-visa",55
"JERRY","How could you go in there?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,","the-visa",55
"JERRY","Well, what happened?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","So, what did he do?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me","the-visa",55
"VOICE","Kramer?","the-visa",55
"KRAMER","Yeah? It's my Chinese food.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit","the-visa",55
"PING","Not anymore.","the-visa",55
"ELAINE","What?","the-visa",55
"PING","Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.","the-visa",55

"PING","She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait","the-visa",55
"BABU","So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he","the-visa",55
"BABU","I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America,","the-visa",55
"THE END"," THE END","the-visa",55
"GEORGE","Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, ""I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!""","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","That's funny, that's funny! ""I'm sick of cleaning."" That's very funny.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah, it's funny!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I mean, how funny is this?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","It's funny.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. We should try and get her into this scene.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters. (Thinks) What does she say...?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I don't know, what do women say?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Alright, forget Elaine.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Hey.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Who?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Did you talk to her?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","So what happened?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah, I know about the three dates.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","You know what I did? I snubbed her.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What do you mean, you snubbed her?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Right by her?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Right by her!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. Your loyalty is beyond question.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","I'm not even in here!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah, I know.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","You have no idea?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","I thought I'd find you here.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Well, Gail Cunningham.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Hi, Gail.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Why?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","He snubbed me.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Are you sure?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","I thought you were finished.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Well, tell him that I am mad at him.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Pfeiffer's.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Ah, the power lunch crowd.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Nice shoes!","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Oh. Thank you.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Where'd you get 'em?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","They're um, Botticelli's.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Really.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Would you care to join us?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","See ya.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","""Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.""","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","That bothered you?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","It did?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Yes! Couldn't you see that?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","No. This is why you're not in the pilot.","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Yeah, I feel like I've grown.","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Yes, yes I did.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Well, what'd you think?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Uh...it was...good.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","You didn't like it?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Well, no, I -","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","It wasn't funny.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","No, I didn't find it funny.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?","the-shoes",56
"DANA","Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.","the-shoes",56
"DANA","George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do.","the-shoes",56
"DANA","I think you'd better go.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","I guess she didn't think it was funny.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I thought your mother's paying for it.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.""","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Well, you know, I...","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You what?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Yeah, I kissed her.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You kissed her?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Right on the mouth.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","And what did she do?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","She kissed me back.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Ooh, so...I understand you're buying new shoes now at Botticelli's.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","What? Who told you that?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Gail Cunningham.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Well, you know, we were just talking, and she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","""How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!"" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","So what?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Hey! Gail!","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Elaine...!","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Why are you talking about my shoes?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","What?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","What are you talking about?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)","the-shoes",56
"WAITER","Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Look Elaine, I am very busy here.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","I am not discussing this. This is insane.","the-shoes",56
"WAITER","You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! (Gail passes the plate to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC.) Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Thank you.","the-shoes",56
"WAITER","Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Well, come in. (They shake hands.) Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Are you alright?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Where did you eat?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Pfeiffer's.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Ah. I know the chef there.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Yeah. The food's usually terrific.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","What are you saying?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Oh, you have a daughter?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Pasta primavera.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","No!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","So, you were saying how, um...about the script...","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","More jokes?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Another ending?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Maybe we should go.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Oh God. Oh my god.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","Hello.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Hi.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Hi.","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","I'm Molly.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I'm Jerry.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","George.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","We're here discussing our script with your father.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","Daddy? Are you okay?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Yeah, sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","So, you live with your mother, huh?","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","Uh, yeah.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","It's just a stomach thing.","the-shoes",56
"MOLLY","Yuck.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Get a good look, Costanza?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What were you doing?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","That's why I poked.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","What?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Pasta primavera?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","She is?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Hello? Oh, hi Stu.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","From NBC?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","He poked me!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","But she was fifteen.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Hey, now you're onto something.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine, but...somebody like Gail, though.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Yah-hey.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Alright, I'll call her right now. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","She said she'll do it.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Beautiful.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","But she wants the shoes.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","What?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","She says she wants those shoes.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","No, these were the last pair of these that they had!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I'll get you another one just like it!","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Never mind!","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Alright, what size are you?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Seven-and-a-half.","the-shoes",56
"KRAMER","Eh! Bingo.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Hey! Whattaya know!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Look who's here!","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Fancy meeting you here!","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Oh. Hello.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Didn't hear anything...","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","It just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","No.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Do you have a...ketchup secret?","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)","the-shoes",56
"RUSSELL","Field of vision, huh?","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","How's everything?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Mmmm.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Really good.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","This pasta primavera is fabulous.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Very tasty.","the-shoes",56
"GAIL","How'd everything go with that NBC guy?","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Great.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Well, it's a funny idea.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","It's funny!","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","C'mon, funny is funny.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","If you can.","the-shoes",56
"GEORGE","Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?","the-shoes",56
"ELAINE","Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)","the-shoes",56
"THE END"," THE END","the-shoes",56
"JERRY","I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited","the-outing",57
"ALLISON","I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because","the-outing",57
"ALLISON","No... You're *something*.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and","the-outing",57
"ALLISON","You're good. You're *good*!","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","I'm bad. I'm *bad*!","the-outing",57
"ALLISON","You're *killing* me!","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Over you?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls"".","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","I got him a two-line phone.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Unbelievable! She's not there.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","What paper does she write for?","the-outing",57
"JERRY","The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","(Proudly) Really?","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Living or all time?","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","All time.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","(indignantly) What's the matter with you?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","(quietly) C'mon, go along...","the-outing",57
"JERRY","I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-","the-outing",57
"STEPPING PAST ME","""C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...""","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Y'know I hear that all the time.","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Hear what?","the-outing",57
"JERRY","That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.","the-outing",57
"ELAINE","And you get along well with women.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","I guess that leaves me in the clear...","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Yeah, how did you know that?","the-outing",57
"JERRY","You told me that already like two months ago.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Allison bought it for me.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","How you gonna get out of *that* one?","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?","the-outing",57
"SHARON","Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Jerry did you wash this pear?","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Yeah, I washed it.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","It looks like it hasn't been washed.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","So *wash* *it*.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","You hear the way he talks to me?","the-outing",57
"SHARON","You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...","the-outing",57
"GEROGE","Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?","the-outing",57
"SHARON","It's nice.","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","Jerry said he didn't like it.","the-outing",57
"JERRY","I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...","the-outing",57
"GEORGE","No, you said you didn't like it...","the-outing",57
"JERRY","Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or","the-outing",57

"SIDRA","Oh, hi Jerry.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Really.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Thursday night.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Alright.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Good workout?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Tremendous workout.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","That's a pretty girl.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Tremendous girl.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","She's the one you went out with last night?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Yeah. I really like her.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","You know, uh...they're fake.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","What? Don't say that!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Nah! They're fake!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","How do you know?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Yes, they do!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","No.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I don't want to see her naked.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well, I do.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Well, that's your problem.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","What's his problem?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Wrong side?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","He can't go left.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Nah, we just play defense.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?","the-implant",59
"BETSY","Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","I'll shout.","the-implant",59
"BETSY","Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?","the-implant",59
"BETSY","What? (The phone rings.)","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","No, no, the machine'll get it...","the-implant",59
"BETSY","No, no, it's not on...","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","They'll call back.","the-implant",59
"BETSY","But George, what if it's an emergency?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?","the-implant",59
"BETSY","George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Alright, maybe four.","the-implant",59
"BETSY","So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You're sure?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","What? Just 'cause of that?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well, I take it very seriously.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Well, I know what they feel like.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You? How do you know?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I thought you hated Los Angeles.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Real busy now down at the office?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You put her on a pedestal.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","I put them on a dental chair.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","He puts 'em on a dental chair.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","That's funny. You're a funny guy.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Why, you think I should?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","I'm the consolation guy...?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Consolation Guy is big.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","It's like ten dates in one shot.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","What?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Really?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Oh, that's o.k.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Did he give you a reason?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Really?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Yes! How did you know?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, I know the type.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","So you can relate?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls ""right into them."")","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You fell on her?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I touched 'em.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You what?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I...touched...'em.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","You touched 'em?!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Wow.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Anyway...they're real.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Excuse me?!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I think they might be real.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I've touched mine!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","So have I.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.","the-implant",59
"CLERK","Oh, I'm very sorry.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...","the-implant",59
"CLERK","You poor thing!","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","I...I...","the-implant",59
"I...I..."," I...I...","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.","the-implant",59
"CLERK","You're a good friend.","the-implant",59
"CLERK","Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","The death certificate?","the-implant",59
"CLERK","Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?","the-implant",59
"CLERK","I know! But it happens.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?","the-implant",59
"CLERK","That would be $387 round-trip.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?","the-implant",59
"CLERK","Yes.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Hey!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Hey. George off to Detroit?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.","the-implant",59
"ELAINE","Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Pffft - wrong.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","There's Sidra.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","There's Salman.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Where?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Talkin' to that woman.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Talkin' to Sidra?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","I don't think that's Salman.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Well, I don't think they're real.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","If that's Rushdie, they're real.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","If they're real, that's Rushdie.","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","My name's Kramer.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","So, uh...what kind of work do you do?","the-implant",59
"BETSY","Have you met my boyfriend George?","the-implant",59
"AUNT MAY","No! (shakes George's hand.)","the-implant",59
"BETSY","George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.","the-implant",59
"AUNT MAY","Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.","the-implant",59
"AUNT MAY","Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?","the-implant",59
"BETSY","I'm not very hungry.","the-implant",59
"AUNT MAY","They have some very nice snacks.","the-implant",59
"FATHER JESSUP","I'm about to get myself a snack.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.","the-implant",59
"FATHER JESSUP","This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)","the-implant",59
"FATHER JESSUP","You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","C'mon Jerry!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Oh, how can you be so sure?","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","What, did you ask her?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","I'm gonna find out tonight.","the-implant",59
"KRAMER","Oh, yes indeed...","the-implant",59
"DR. ALLENWOOD","Why do you need a death certificate?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.","the-implant",59
"DR. ALLENWOOD","Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Oh, that would be wonderful.","the-implant",59
"DR. ALLENWOOD","It was very nice meeting you, George.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Likewise.","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","What are you doing?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","What?","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","Did...did you just double-dip that chip?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Excuse me?","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","You double-dipped the chip!","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","So...?","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","Oh, you don't, huh?","the-implant",59
"GEORGE","No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)","the-implant",59
"TIMMY","Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.)","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Hey, would you mind switching seats?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Why?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","O.K....(they switch places.)","the-implant",59
"JERRY","How ya doin'?","the-implant",59
"SIDRA","Good. How you doin'?","the-implant",59
"JERRY","Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.","the-implant",59

"JERRY","Well there's spaces there, they must drive!","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.","the-handicap-spot",62

"ELAINE","Must have been an accident...","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?","the-handicap-spot",62
"WOMAN","Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Is she OK?","the-handicap-spot",62
"WOMAN","I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out","the-handicap-spot",62

"JERRY","What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","You'd think...","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","Most of them don't even have batteries.","the-handicap-spot",62

"ELAINE","I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","No chance in hell!","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started","the-handicap-spot",62
"SCREAMING","""There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!"" And then, when they all run into","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","That's good, we'll give it a try...","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","That's good...","the-handicap-spot",62

"ESTELLE","Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!","the-handicap-spot",62

"ELAINE","Oh, cristal clear!","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","They know how to make 'em...","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?","the-handicap-spot",62
"THE DRAKE","Gagliano's... that's pretty good...","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Well... we should...","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Get movin'...","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","But this'll get you around?","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","Like what?","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","For example, your tremor-damping.","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","Now what's that?","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.","the-handicap-spot",62
"KRAMER","Well, is it alright if I try it?","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","Hop in!","the-handicap-spot",62

"GEORGE","How much?","the-handicap-spot",62
"SALESMAN","How about $240?","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Drake gave her the TV?","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","I know it is!","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","They don't know anybody in Chicago.","the-handicap-spot",62

"ELAINE","Well, she has it!","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!","the-handicap-spot",62
"GEORGE","Maybe we should call her.","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Well, who's gonna call?","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","You are.","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Because that's your thing!","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Yeah, that's your thing.","the-handicap-spot",62
"ELAINE","Alright, gimme the phone... it's my ""thing""...","the-handicap-spot",62

"GEORGE","Well, it was slightly used...","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","Used?","the-handicap-spot",62

"THE END"," THE END","the-handicap-spot",62
"JERRY","To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: ""Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch."" According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.","the-pilot-part-1",63

"JERRY","Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Neither are you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","My grandmother's in the hospital.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","This is real believable.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","What you didn't think I was really laughing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","It stinks.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Let me see you do it.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Say something funny.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Ah..........","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Why are two pretending to be laughing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","We're acting. (they stop laughing)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(to George) Yeah!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Out of the question.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Oughh!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","I really appreciate you coming.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","That was two months ago.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","But I want you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","Is it something I said... or did?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that ""Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?"" guy.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Really? What is it about?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","There's a show. that's a show.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"RUSSELL","(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to George) Again with the sweat pants?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What? I'm comfortable.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: ""I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."" (George is baffled)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to Kramer) Who is it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","That's NBC.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","NBC!?! Give me the phone!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","I'm in the middle of a conversation here.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Get off the phone!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Russell Dalrimple's secretary.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","I thought you didn't believe in God?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","I do for the bad things.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","It's like a discoloration. It's white.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","You'd better get that checked out.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Better get that checked out?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","I would.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","I'm trying to help you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DANA","I think you'd better go.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Where?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Right here. (showing his lip)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CABBIE","Yeah, it's like a discoloration.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Oh, my God.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CABBIE","Yeah, it's all white.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Would you stop?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CABBIE","I would get that checked out if I were you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Catch what in time?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Whatever it is.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","You think it's something?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CABBIE","Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JOE DEVOLA","(through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(to Jay) What do you think it is?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JAY","It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","O.K. guys, are we ready to start?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JAY","He must be worried about the fall schedule.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","Ah, it's a real bear.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","Yeah. Right.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","Hey how you doing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(thinking) This guy's perfect.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","No. Why?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: ""Vandelay Industries"".","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","I'm Vandelay Industries?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","Right.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","What is that?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","You're in latex.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","What do I do with latex?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MARK","I don't know, you manufacture it.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ALL","Hi Michael. How you doing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Everything all right?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","Any questions?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","No, not a loser!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","So?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","He was what?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","That's a massage.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MICHAEL","I think it moved.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","This is Melissa Shannon.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","Hi.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ALL","Hi. How you doing.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","Melissa is reading for Elaine.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No you didn't. He knows he's bald.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","Oh, great.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Alright, want to start?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","Yeah.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","O.K.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"O.K."," O.K.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","Ahem. What was that look?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What look?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","That look you just gave me?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","I gave a look?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MELISSA","Yes.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","Let's see some more Kramers.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ALL","Hi. How you doing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","(to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","What is this about?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","(standing) Levels.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","Levels?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Very nice","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Very good","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Very nice Tom, that was terrific.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","May I? (pointing the box of raisins)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to George) It was a wonderful reading.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Yeah. Really.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","Well, bye.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yeah, I liked him.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","What happened to the raisins?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JAY","Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Did he just steal the raisins?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","You think he stole them?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","(enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to Kramer) What are you doing here?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"CASTING DIRECTOR","You two know each other?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","That's true.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"STU","I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","So who's playing Elaine?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Really?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yes.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Who is it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","She's an eskimo, actually.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Listen, was Russell at the casting?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No, he didn't show up.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No. No you're not.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Why do I keep setting you up?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Beside that. Look at the waitresses.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Ah...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Yes, I would say.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What's going on here. How is that possible?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Do you think it's a coincidence?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"WAITRESS","He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","You see, It's right here. It's all white...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DOCTOR","Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","You've never seen this before?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DOCTOR","I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(dramatically) A what?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DOCTOR","A biopsy.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","A biopsy?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DOCTOR","Yeah.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"DOCTOR","Well I don't know what it is.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","A biopsy!","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What did he say?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","He said he didn't know what it was.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Alright. So?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear: ""Cancer? Get outta here?""","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school: ""Cancer? Get outta here!"" ""Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Can't you at least die with a little dignity?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Hey. What happened to you yesterday?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","I got mugged.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","You got mugged?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Mugged?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","It's me.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","But now I have a big problem, buddy.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What is it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","You didn't go?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","No. And now I can't get it back.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","How could you not think about it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","(mumbles and leaves)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","What's the matter with him?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","He's a little backed up.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh...","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Elaine.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","Apply for a job? What for?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirt, untucked)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"GEORGE","It's a coincidence.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","This is what you gonna wear?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","You're not gonna get the job.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Exactly.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Who was it?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","What about the dogs?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","They're having sex in the hotel room.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Yes.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","And she's really your ex-girlfriend?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Uh, Huh, yeah.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","How would she eat a hamburger?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","With her hands.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","What about pasta?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Also with her hands.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Everything?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Everything.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","That's good. What's her favorite movie?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Shaft.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","You got to get me a picture. What about sex?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","She likes talking during sex.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Oh... dirty talking?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Elaine.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","What?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Call me Elaine.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","All right. Elaine.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","How does Elaine kiss?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Well--","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--","the-pilot-part-1",63
"SANDI","Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"JERRY","I think you got it.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","I'll have a hamburger. That's it.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","You gotta play him like me. I'm Karmer.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","I'm Kramer.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"KRAMER","Whoa, I'm Kramer.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MR. VISAKI","(foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MR. VISAKI","(looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MR. VISAKI","I don't think I need anyone else right now.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)","the-pilot-part-1",63
"MR. VISAKI","What? What did I do?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"FRED","Who's Russ Meyer?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"FRED","Anyway, go on.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"FRED","(to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"PAUL","(to Elaine) Hi.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"FRED","Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.","the-pilot-part-1",63
"PAUL","(to Elaine) Really?","the-pilot-part-1",63
"THE END"," THE END","the-pilot-part-1",63
"TOM","What do you mean made up?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","You're crazy.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MICHAEL","What do you mean Danish?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Danish. Is it from Denmark?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MICHAEL","No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","(to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: ""take #!"") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: ""They fooled *me* Jerry!"" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: ""They *fooled* me Jerry!"". You see the difference?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","I'm not gonna say it like that.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"YELLING GUY","(with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Why is that?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Why would he steal a box of raisins?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","(to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","What?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","You O.K.?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","What's the matter?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Nothing.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","No.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","Are you breaking up with me?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Are we going out?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Do you want me to break up with you?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","If that's what you want.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","I don't even know what you're talking about.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","Fine. Break up with me.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","All right. We're broken up.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","(little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Remember when you came to audition for us?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","Yeah.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","What are you talking about?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no--","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","(angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"DAVID","Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","All right. All right. What's your name?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"DAVID","David Richardson.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","Get out! You're fired!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"DAVID","But Mr. Dalrimple--","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","What do you mean?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Come on you're... uh... you're fine.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","The guy playing Kramer threatened me.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Why?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","'cause I asked him about the raisins.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","You mentioned the raisins.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Oh yeah.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Did he take 'em?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","That's what I'm trying to find out.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Hey.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Any luck?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","What about bran?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Oh, it's not that bad!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Yes it is.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","We need you there!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","(to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ASSISTANT DRESSER","Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?","the-pilot-part-2",64

"ELAINE","Oh, right.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"WILTON","Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MICHAEL","I can't remember my lines!!!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Just relax, you'll be fine.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MICHAEL","I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MICHAEL","Help me Jerry! Help me!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","(to Stu) Where is Russell?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"STU","You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JAY","He hasn't been well.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"STU","(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","How pathetic.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"PAT HAZELL","Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JOE DEVOLA","(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Really? What does it mean?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","It means: ""Death to tyrants"".","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","I can see that.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?","the-pilot-part-2",64

"JERRY","I'm not sending him to your house.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","Why not?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TOM","Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","But I don't want to.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","(from the buzzer's speaker) It's Elaine.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"CHARLES","I need more Pledge.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"CHARLES","Well, it goes fast.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","(to Charles, very friendly) Hello.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"CHARLES","Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","What's all this about?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","We had a date.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SANDI","Why do I need your permission?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Because he's my butler!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MORTY","That's terrific!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"HELEN","How could anyone not like him?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"C.K.","I like his style. He has a sort of casual elegance.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"TIA","But he picks his nose.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"C.K.","Nevertheless...","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SAL BASS","He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SIDRA","Yeah...","the-pilot-part-2",64
"SAL BASS","You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) ""Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you"".","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ALL","(applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","That was so good.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Do you really think so?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Oh yeah.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","And God didn't kill me.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","(to the phone) Hello?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Oh, hi Rita.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Oh, my God. Did he get fired?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Russell's disappeared?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RITA","Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","What-- What are you looking at me for?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","It was you!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","What did I do?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Yes it is! You're very charming!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","No one knows.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"RUSSELL","She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MAN ON RAFT","You'd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires)","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","Hey look at this. What is going on here?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Well, well, well.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"FRED","Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"PAUL","Yeah, we're checking it out.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","(to Paul) You're checking it out?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MAN","(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","Get away with what?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Ah, ""with what?"" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","Of course they're alike. They're my daughters.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","Oh, here's a table for you.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","A table right here.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","Peggy!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","What a family!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MR. VISAKI","My daughter Peggy.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"ELAINE","Hi Peggy.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","What?","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Start looking for a job.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"KRAMER","You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"GEORGE","Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.","the-pilot-part-2",64
"MAN","Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!","the-pilot-part-2",64
"THE END"," THE END","the-pilot-part-2",64
"JERRY","A female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave. A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","So, what's her name?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Karin.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Is she nice?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Great.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","So you like her?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I think so.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You don't know?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I can't tell anymore.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well do you feel anything?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Feel? What's that?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Cleaning","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You do the tub?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","On your knees, Ajax, scrubbing, the whole deal?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Okay, I think you're in love!","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Tub is love?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yep. There's one little problem.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Sexual?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Below the equator?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I don't know. Last time I got the tap.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You got the tap?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","The tap is tough.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","It's a very complicated area.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","It's a haaazy mystery.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Who's faking?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Nothing.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Faking what?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Nobody's faking.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Ah! Orgasm?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","She's not faking!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","How do you know?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Of course.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Really?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","You faked?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","On occasion.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","And the guy never knows?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","How can he not know that?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Because I was gooood.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You didn't know.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You didn't know.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Are you saying...","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I think I'll have a piece of cake.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","With me?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Well...","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You faked with me?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You faked with me?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","No.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You faked it?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I faked it.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Not bad huh?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Fake, fake, fake, fake.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Uuuhm, all the time.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","All the time?!","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","We got a chocolate malt in here!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","But I'm so good.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I'm sure you are.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","She faked.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Maybe they've all been faking.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I'm sure they're not.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Maybe Karin is faking.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","She was probably joking.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","No no, it was no joke.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","She didn't have any?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","No. None.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","She faked 'em all.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Faked 'em all.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Well so she faked 'em, so what?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yeah I could have helped you out.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What could you have done?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Aaaaah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Giddy-up.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Hello... Oh hello Elaine.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","So we're having dinner tonight?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Nooo, the other thing.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oooh that. Well...","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Okay.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","All right.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","All right, see you later.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Bye.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Bye.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: have you ever... you know... faked it?","the-mango",65
"RENE","Yeah, sometimes.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Really, like when?","the-mango",65
"RENE","Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yeah, well...","the-mango",65
"RENE","Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I really don't feel like seeing her.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","You know, I faked it.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What?!","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You faked it? Why would you do that?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah, but why would you...","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Bad peach?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","It's terrible!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Did you get that at Joe's?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're returning used fruit?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Jerry this peach is sub par.","the-mango",65
"JOE","So what do you want me to do?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","I want restitution.","the-mango",65
"JOE","Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Because it's no good.","the-mango",65
"JOE","When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.","the-mango",65
"JOE","I stand behind my fruit.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","So...","the-mango",65
"JOE","Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.","the-mango",65
"JOE","Well let me put a solution for you: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Oh now you don't want my business.","the-mango",65
"JOE","No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","But what am I gonna do for fruit?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","I'm very satisfied.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Maybe.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Generally.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","No, I feel full after the Risotto.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Yeah... full.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Satisfied?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Meryl Streep?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You don't like her?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Ah, she's okay.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","What's the matter?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Nothing.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You're not still thinking about that are you?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Nooo.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Oh good.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Give me another shot!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","What?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Another shot, I want another shot.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You mean...?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yes!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Oooh no, I don't think so.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Jerry no, that's important to me.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","We won't ruin the friendship.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yes we will!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Elaine...","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","A half hour, give me a half our.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","That is so ridiculous.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Come on, Elaine!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Elaine?!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No!","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","It's Jerry's fault.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Jerry?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","So you feel okay?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Well, it's not like after the Risotto.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well good night.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oh what, you're upset?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","No I can't, maybe you're faking.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I'm really, really sorry I told you that.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I'm sorry too.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Well stop being such a baby.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're a baby!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You're a baby!","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'","the-mango",65
"JERRY","They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I hate 'em!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Why can't you get it?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.","the-mango",65

"KRAMER","Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","No. (And to Kramer:) I told you not to say anything.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Okay, bye.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Patty Lawrence had 'em!","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","All right now here's the list.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","I like mangos.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Well they gotta be soft.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","How soft?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Oh! And get some plantains.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Plantains?","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What the hell is a plantain.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're not getting any plantains.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Hey Joe.","the-mango",65
"JOE","How is it going?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it.","the-mango",65
"JOE","All right, all right, just hold it right there.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What?","the-mango",65
"JOE","This fruit isn't for you.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What, what are you talking about?","the-mango",65
"JOE","You think I don't know? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I can't buy mangos and plantains?","the-mango",65
"JOE","All right, get out!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're making a big mistake, Joe!","the-mango",65
"JOE","I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're saying you're banning me from the store?","the-mango",65
"JOE","That's exactly what I'm saying.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I'm banned?!","the-mango",65
"JOE","You're banned.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","All right, where do you want it?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Put it over there.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","All right I gotta get going.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","This mango is delicious!","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Sorry, I don't have any cash.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","I only got hundreds.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","All right I knew it.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I don't want any mango.","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Come on, take some. It's good.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","I told you.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What is it?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Hi George.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I'm back, baby, I'm back!","the-mango",65
"KRAMER","Want some mango?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","No, thanks.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Oh and I've got some things of yours here.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I know.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Well I'll get them.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","I'm waiting.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","All right. You got my fins?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","They're next to the fins. You got my cards?","the-mango",65
"JERRY","They're next to the poker chips.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","All right and that just about... does it.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","I guess.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Okay, well... see you around.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Yeah, see you.","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","What?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Come on!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Are you serious?","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.","the-mango",65
"JERRY","Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to...","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Oh George, oooh.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Please, it's not necessary.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","What do you mean it's not necessary?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","What are you talking about?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","What, what?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","You think I was faking?","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","I'd like you to leave.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","What?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","But why?","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Because I said so.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I can't find my glasses.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Well hurry up.","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I need to look for my glasses.","the-mango",65
"KARIN","Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!","the-mango",65
"JERRY","It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!","the-mango",65
"ELAINE","You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?","the-mango",65
"THE END"," THE END","the-mango",65
"GEORGE","I can't believe this!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Oh, it won't be for that long.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","How can you compare you parents to my parents?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","A smirk?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Well, move in here.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Stopping the notion) What's that?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Why doesn't he just move in here?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","You can move in with me, if you want.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Hello, Mrs. Costanza.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","Hello, Kramer. Close the door.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","More stuff?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yeah. (Exits)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","(To George) How much is there?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Annoyed) There's more.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","So, how are ya, Jerry?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","No thanks.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I really don't eat it.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Muttering) No, that's it.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Wha - what are you doing later?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Really?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Right.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELIANE","You remember that?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, that was a good one.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Well..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","What's that?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Excuse me?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yeah.. yeah.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Yep. Yeah..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","(Interested) Oh?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Oh, a puffy shirt.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Puffy.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Uh, oh! (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the ""Today"" show on Friday.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yeah, that's right!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Sure.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Uh-huh.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Yep.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yep..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Mmm","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","Maybe you should take a civil service test.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","Why don't you want to take a civil service test?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","So what are you gonna do?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ESTELLE","George, where are you going?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","Hmm..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","What?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","What about them?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","They're quite exquisite!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","They are?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')","the-puffy-shirt",66
"WOMAN","(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Me neither!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","What is it?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","They're hands!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","This woman just set me up for a job!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Hey.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","What?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","You coulda damaged my hand!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Explaining) George has become a hand model.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","A hand model?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Yes.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","(To George) Really? Let me look at them..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Oven mitts?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yeah..","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","Thank you very much. (Walks out)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","What are you talking about?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Goes up to it) This?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yes!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I agreed to wear this?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","But, when did I do that?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","When we went to dinner the other night.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","What are you, crazy?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","There you go.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","Yes, yes! You said it!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"KRAMER","(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!","the-puffy-shirt",66

"ESTELLE","Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work) Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"FRANK","(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!","the-puffy-shirt",66

"ELAINE","(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why!","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"ELAINE","I didn't hear anything.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"JERRY","(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!","the-puffy-shirt",66

"GEORGE","(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"MAN","(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","You mean, uh..?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"MAN","Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?","the-puffy-shirt",66
"MAN","(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing","the-puffy-shirt",66
"GEORGE","(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.","the-puffy-shirt",66

That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... (?), you're exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.","the-glasses",67

"JERRY","So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","You don't have an old pair?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","I broke 'em playing basketball.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","He was running from a bee.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","There's a lot of change down there.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!","the-glasses",67

"GEORGE","Oh, no, nothing.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","What is it?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","I can't tell you.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Jerry, can we go?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you can't tell me?","the-glasses",67

"GEORGE","You do know Kramer?","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","Yes...","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Well, I'm mentioning his name.","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","Why?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Because... you know...","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","But he was squinting.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!","the-glasses",67
"DOCTER","Okay.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?","the-glasses",67
"DOCTER","Not shot, dog bite.","the-glasses",67

"JERRY","I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","Yesterday?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.","the-glasses",67
"AMY","I didn't do anything.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Oh you must have done something.","the-glasses",67
"AMY","No, nothing really.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","Well, I did go out for a little while.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Well, your day's getting more interesting already.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.","the-glasses",67
"AMY","You can't thrust anyone.","the-glasses",67

"JERRY","There isn't?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","No.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","I had a feeling this was to good to be true.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Why?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","I knew there had to be another side to you.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","No, no, there's no side!","the-glasses",67
"AMY","There is a side, an ugly side.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","No, no, no ugly side.","the-glasses",67
"AMY","Look, I think I'm gonna go.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Why?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","It's really hot in here.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?","the-glasses",67
"AMY","Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","I was an idiot for listening to you!","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Hey, I saw what I saw.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","What side?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","A bad side, an ugly side.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Ooh, so what?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Ah, he'd just deny it.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","There must be some way to find out.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Amy said nothing happened.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Hey look, a dime.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Mercury head. You mind?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","(Stunned:) No, keep it.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","A little white dog?","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","I'm afraid of dogs now.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","He's like a squirrel.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Well he frightened me.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Did you get the shot?","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","No. He said I didn't need a shot.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","What, you think I should have?","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","The AC is on his way.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","What?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","That's right, no discount!","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Well did you mention my name?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Yes, I mentioned your name.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","And?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Bubkis!","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","You know, George, that's an union.","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Yes it is.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","I saw them making out, you can believe it.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Right this way, mister Doody!","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","You'll see I'm right.","the-glasses",67

"ELAINE","Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...","the-glasses",67
"GEORGE","Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","Who said anything about a discount.","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","For what?","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Remember this?","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","What are you doing?","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","Put that away!","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.","the-glasses",67
"ELAINE","Can I just have the name...","the-glasses",67
"DWAYNE","Out!","the-glasses",67
"KRAMER","We'll see you Dwayne.","the-glasses",67

"ELAINE","(While reading a book:) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!","the-glasses",67
"JERRY","(To George:) Who picked these out?","the-glasses",67

"JERRY","Did you see that?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","See what?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","Yes, I saw that.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"ELAINE","I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Then, what was all that sniffing?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Maybe it's the cold weather.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Today is not cold.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting me.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"ESTELLE","He doesn't know anything about bras.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","I am not giving him a bra.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Why not?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","Because I don't need him looking at my bra.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","Do we have to...?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","You don't even know what they're made from.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","They are made from lycra-spandex.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","I think they are made from lycra-spandex.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"ESTELLE","I'm not betting!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Take a look.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","All right, I'll get a bra.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","She doesn't want to get a bra.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","All right, it wouldn't kill me.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","I-I know about the cups.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"ESTELLE","Here, here's the bra.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Let me see it.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Let me see it.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","I told you. Here, think you know everything?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"FRANK","Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"GEORGE","I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ESTELLE","You got ketchup on it!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Sniffing, with his nose.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Jerry, he probably had a cold.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","No, I asked him.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","So, what are you saying?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","I don't know, you know, what if...?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Drugs? You think he's on drugs?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","I don't know. All I know he was sniffing.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","I know.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this guy. We trusted you.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","No, he didn't use 'man'.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Whoh!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Do you think that's a bad sign?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Hello.... hello, oh...","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Well, you notice anything?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Ooh...","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Did anyone call?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","I got a few messages, I wrote them down.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Where are they?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Lets see, they are...here they are.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","She did.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","She did? Oh, that's so great!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Where do you keep the corkscrew?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","In the drawer on the right. Hmm...","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","What?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Oh it's nothing.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","What is it?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","It's nothing.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Tell me.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","What are you talking about?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","So?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","What's so curious about it?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JAKE","Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","You're out of your mind you know that.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","What?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Well, I felt a call for one.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","George was right. Didn't take you long.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Anything new on that guy on drugs?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","He's not on drugs.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Then why the sniffing? Who walks around sniff, sniff sniffing?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Good idea.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"VOICE ON THE PHONE","Prophet and Goldstein.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"JERRY","South America?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","South America?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Yyyeeaaah!!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","So what?","the-sniffing-accountant",68

"ELAINE","People go to South America.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Yes, I'm impugning a continent.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"NEWMAN","Hey, hey...","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"JERRY","Hello Newman.","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"NEWMAN","Hello Jerry. So, any news?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"KRAMER","Yeah, he skipped out and ptruut went to South America!","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"NEWMAN","South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us mixed up with?","the-sniffing-accountant",68
"ELAINE","Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.","the-sniffing-accountant",68

Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love...

"JERRY","I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.","the-lip-reader",70

"DRIVER","Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","No no, no no.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?","the-lip-reader",70

"JERRY","I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Wow good plan.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY AND KRAMER","No.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","That's nice.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","That's nice for the freaks.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Oh, thanks Kramer.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Well there ought to be ball men.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.","the-lip-reader",70

"JERRY","Did she say why?","the-lip-reader",70

"GEORGE","Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Cracks? What were they saying?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","She must have seen me eating it on TV.","the-lip-reader",70

"GEORGE","Why not. I would be.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","You're parents saw me on TV?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","It felt like 8 seconds.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Can we move on?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.","the-lip-reader",70
"TV."," TV.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Yes I do.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Excellent question.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","I beg to differ.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Really.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Well we can take the car service from my office.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Really?","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","Yeah, they don't know.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","All right, I'll see you later.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Okay.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Oh. (he stands there)","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want to tag along with you or anything.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","They never have napkins there.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","They're breaking up? How do you know?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","She reads lips.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","What are they saying now?","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","""It's not you, it's me.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Uh Laura, George was wondering if...","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","Sure. I'll do it.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","So I really had a good time.","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","Yeah, me too.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","So you want to go to the party on Friday night?","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","Yeah.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?","the-lip-reader",70
"MAN","Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.","the-lip-reader",70
"BOY","Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","I may be old, but I'm spry.","the-lip-reader",70
"BOY","The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Oh I'll be up for it punk.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh"".","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Eh.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","It seems like a problem.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","You're kidding.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","When is that car service comming?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I know. It's like X-ray vision.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.","the-lip-reader",70
"NEWMAN","I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Can't do it Newman.","the-lip-reader",70
"NEWMAN","But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Not going to happen.","the-lip-reader",70
"NEWMAN","(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Pardon me sir?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I said pull over by the stop sign.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","-ca.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Huh?","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","What?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","ca.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","ah.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","She doesn't know what she's talking about.","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","Guys you made it.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Hey hey.","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","Sorry to hear about Gwen.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","You are so centered.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""Hi Gwen, hi tide.""","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Hi tide?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","Hi Todd.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""You've got something between your teeth""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","What?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup."" So do I.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.","the-lip-reader",70
"GWEN","I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","What?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""You want me to sleep with you?""","the-lip-reader",70
"TODD","I don't want to sweep alone.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, oh boy, ""love to.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?","the-lip-reader",70
"GWEN","What? You're crazy.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""What? You're crazy.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","I heard your whole conversation.","the-lip-reader",70
"GWEN","How?","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""How?""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.","the-lip-reader",70
"GWEN","No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""... with a broom, cleaning up.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Sweep?","the-lip-reader",70
"GWEN","Yes sweep.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","""Yes sweep.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Cut it.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","George says ""Cut it.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Cut it.","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","George is saying ""Cut it.""","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing? She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep together.""","the-lip-reader",70
"KRAMER","I know how to sign.","the-lip-reader",70
"GEORGE","Ow. My eye, my eye.","the-lip-reader",70
"ELAINE","It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in the finals.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","Thus ends the great ball man experiment.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","You with the tennis center?","the-lip-reader",70
"LAURA","Yep.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't that something.","the-lip-reader",70
"DRIVER","Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)","the-lip-reader",70
"THE END"," THE END","the-lip-reader",70
"JERRY","I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hmm!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Fantastic!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","I told you. How good is this?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","How good?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Very good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","They got blue berries. And there's real blue berries. What","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and they put it","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Let me test-taste that.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Huh? Huh?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hmm! Rico!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Suave! And it's non-fat!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","See, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","You want to taste mine?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, you want to taste mine.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","No, I don't.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Okay, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","All right, let's just forget it.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","You know, Kramer's going to clean up on this place.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","What do you mean?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","He invested in it.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","No kidding?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LADY","Jerry!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh, I'm sorry.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, god. Look who's here.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Who is it?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd: Braun. He's a","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh, really?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Hey, George!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Hey! Lloyd! My friend Jerry.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","So, I hear you're living back home now?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place,","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I bumped my elbow on a","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Wow, that's a bitch, huh?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","So, how are your parents doing?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, pretty good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","This place does some business, huh?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yeah, this is my first time here.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71

"ELAINE","Boy, he is really cute!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","He's a jerk.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","He's gone, George.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","All right. All right.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","So, there were a lot of people there, huh?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","They're doing an incredible business.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","How did you know?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Buzz me.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh. Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah, but did you tape it?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yes!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Hey!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","What's the matter?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yow!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","What?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, you're getting heavy. Yeah, you look like you put on","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Kramer!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Me?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","No.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Where's your bathroom scale? Oh my god, I've gained seven","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","I've gained eight.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","I told you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","How did I gain eight?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","No, no, no. That's hundred percent yogurt.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, how else could this have happened?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, maybe it's the Oreos.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I don't eat Oreos.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","You don't eat Oreos? The way you break them open?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","What about me?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","You? You're getting old.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Oh, guess again, Tubby!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Gasp! I've got it.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","What?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubby, if that yogurt has fat in it, I","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, let's start the insanity.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Giddy-up!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","No.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","I like tap dancing.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","What's for supper?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Somebody's at the door.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Lloyd?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Hello, Mrs. Costanza.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Georgie, Lloyd: Braun is here.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","What are you doing here?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother, and","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Georgie. Come here and say hello.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","That's right. Hey, George.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","I ran into George: yesterday in the city.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Ow! What's the matter with you?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","So, uh, how's the arm, huh?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, it's good. It's good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","What's the matter with your arm?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Nothing.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Oh, his arm moves like this.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Me, either.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Well, it comes and goes.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists,","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DISCUSSED GEORGE","with the mayor of New York?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor - there's really","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","All right. All right. I'll go.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. Okay.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","And they said they can do it?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hm-hmm.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","What?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Gee, I'm really sorry.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","I'd be happy to.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Well, it was very nice seeing you again.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Oh, it was good seeing you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","She is. She is. How about giving me her number?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine: Benice.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Oh, great. Thanks a lot!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yeah!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","So long.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Bye! Oh, that Lloyd: Braun. He is something, isn't he?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Hello, Newman.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat,","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","How's it doing?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Not too good.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","So what.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","It changes the molecules.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","That's okay.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Hello, there.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","Hello!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","What do you got there?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Okay, I'm done.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","It was really nice meeting you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, the pleasure's all mine.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","You can't take that chemist out.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Why not?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, I think the whole thing stinks.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","That's enough.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","What?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, with the smells.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Uh-huh.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","I don't care. Look, Lloyd: doesn't know what he's up against.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","So, guess who called me.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","We're going out tomorrow night.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I can't say that.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","So, you're taking his side?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Already you're marrying this guy?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","You never know.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","No, I believe he can.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Hi!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now,","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","You know, Lloyd: advises Dinkins on everything he does.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","He tells him which soap to use.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Where's the lights. Whoa!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","How about this?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","It's delicious.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","I hear you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","Non-fat?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LABBETTE","No.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, this is in case there's a tie!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Name tags, hmm?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Maybe I'll mention that to him.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Really? Wow!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","You sure you don't want any yogurt?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","No, I'm watching my weight.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Well, it's nonfat.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Yeah, so they say.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"LLOYD","Well, should we go?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Yeah. Okay.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","He said that?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","No, but I expect to hear anytime.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Why do you say that?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","No. What about him?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","You didn't hear?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Un-huh.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Name tags?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeow!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Please, doctor.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","I've examined you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","I've looked at your X-rays.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Uh-huh.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Hmm. Really? Nothing?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","No, not really.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","How so?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","I don't know what kind of a person would do something like","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Now, see here, doctor.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"DOCTOR","I said, good-bye.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Fine. Ow!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Okay.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"NEWS","Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GIULIANI","It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Now look what you've done.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . .","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MOM","Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"GEORGE","Phew!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Oh, it stinks.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Mine, too. I got one more day.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","I can't eat this.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","It had fat in it, it's not good for you.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"JERRY","So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"ELAINE","I wonder what actually happened in that lab.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"KRAMER","Yeah, me, too.","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"BOY","Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*!","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"THE END"," THE END","the-non-fat-yogurt",71
"MR. TUTTLE","Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.","the-barber",72
"MR. TUTTLE","That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I enjoy understanding.","the-barber",72
"MR. TUTTLE","I want you to have this job. Of course...","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.","the-barber",72
"MR. TUTTLE","Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I want you to have this job. Of course...","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","That's it.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What do you mean that's it?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","""Of course"" was the last thing he said?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates.""","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","""I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be","the-barber",72
"JERRY","""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.""","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","All right.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Why don't you go ahead and call him?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what","the-barber",72
"JERRY","So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","And if I don't call...","the-barber",72
"JERRY","You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Rest stop supply.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Shower?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Haircut.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Who'd you use? Gino?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","What butcher?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","You never get good haircuts.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Really?","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","What bachelor auction?","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Polio?","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Okay.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","What are you all dressed up for?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I had a job interview.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Yeah. How'd it go?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Good. Of course...","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Oh Jerry.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Oh hi Enzo.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Oh, you've come for the haircut.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","No, actually I was just...","the-barber",72
"ENZO","It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)","the-barber",72
"ENZO","(He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well I don't want to take too much off.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.","the-barber",72
"MAN","Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You gotta do it.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","So what?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I didn't want to hurt his feelings.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. I'm not going to let","the-barber",72
"JERRY","No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I don't want you to call him.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","All right, geez. You're crazy.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","So I still haven't heard about that job.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I have an idea.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I show up.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What do you mean you show up?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Hmm. Not bad.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","What's the worst thing that could happen?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Yeah, so?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","How can I help you?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today.","the-barber",72
"MIKE","Welcome aboard.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.","the-barber",72
"MIKE","I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","He wants to know where his office is.","the-barber",72
"MIKE","Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.","the-barber",72
"MIKE","Really?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love","the-barber",72
"MIKE","All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that","the-barber",72
"JERRY","So what did you do there all day?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","They gave me the Pensky file.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","So it's a nice place to work?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","He'll be back on Monday.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Hi.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I got a haircut.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Oh yeah? Can I see it?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Oh there's nothing to see.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Come on. Let me see it.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Forget it.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Come on.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","All right.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","What? No Jerry, you have to go.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","(dryly) Yeah, too bad.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like scissors, huh? Show me","the-barber",72
"GINO","Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","I'd like to have shoehorn hands.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Yeah, but how am I...","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Can he fix it?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","I don't know.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Thank you.","the-barber",72
"GINO","I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.","the-barber",72
"GINO","I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","That's nice of you to say.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Just a second. Yes.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","(over the speaker) It's your uncle Enzo.","the-barber",72
"GINO","It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?","the-barber",72
"ENZO","I've come to apologize.","the-barber",72

"GINO","He make me cry too. You want something to drink?","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Hey, what's all of this?","the-barber",72
"GINO","Nothing. It's just hair.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","You do haircut in the apartment?","the-barber",72
"GINO","No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","It looks very familiar.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Yeah, so?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I think he knew.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","No. He doesn't know.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Who do you know? He knows my hair.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Okay, okay.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","What happened? It looks the same.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Take the K-man.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","You can still go.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","You think?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Do I think? He's repugnant.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","What would you wear?","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Whatever it takes.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","See, now Newman is a good customer.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.","the-barber",72
"GINO","I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","It's okay. A little crooked.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","What's the catch?","the-barber",72
"ENZO","You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* free haircuts. And a comb.","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","(over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Costanza? Arthur Pensky.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Where's Tuttle?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","He's on vacation.","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. (looks through the file) Looks","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Really?","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","You are aware...","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","(over the speaker) Mr. Castanza?","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Not now Florice.","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","(speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Damn this city.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","I am aware. I am aware.","the-barber",72
"GINO","He knows. He knows about us.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","How do you know?","the-barber",72
"GINO","Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He *staring* at the hair.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Who is it?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","It's Newman.","the-barber",72
"GINO","He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What do you want?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Can I use your bathroom?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","What's wrong with yours?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","My toilet's clogged.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","You can't unclog it?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","No.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Did you ask Kramer?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","He's out.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Number one?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","All right. Flush twice.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","(thinking to himself) (checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","You all right?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Yeah, yeah.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","All right, I'll see you later.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","What are you doing?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Yeah all right.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","You want something to drink?","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","No.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.","the-barber",72
"NEWMAN","It was a cinch. Where are you going?","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Io volgio vandetta.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.","the-barber",72
"WOMAN","A thousand.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.","the-barber",72
"KRAMER","Equivalent.","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. He's uh, self-employed. He's...","the-barber",72
"ELAINE","Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks?","the-barber",72
"JERRY","I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Who is it?","the-barber",72
"ENZO","(yelling) Enzo Manginero.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","No I wasn't there.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.","the-barber",72
"JERRY","Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Don't Jerry.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","So, it's true.","the-barber",72
"GINO","Yes it's true.","the-barber",72
"ENZO","I'm going to kill the both of you.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Mr. Tuttle, you're back.","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","George, I'm surprised to see you here.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You are?","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","I though you would have taken the large office.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Oh. Really.","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","You haven't done anything with this.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.","the-barber",72
"TUTTLE","(scoffs) You're not Pensky material.","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you","the-barber",72
"GEORGE","Obviously.","the-barber",72
"PENSKY","Yes.","the-barber",72
"SECRETARY","(over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.","the-barber",72
"THE END"," THE END","the-barber",72
"JERRY","No eight years isn't such a long streak.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","It isn't?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Get out!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Not since June 29, 1980.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","You remember the date?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: ""Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again.""","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)","the-masseuse",73
"JOANNE","Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah?","the-masseuse",73
"JOANNE","Yeah. What's his name?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Joel...","the-masseuse",73
"JOANNE","Joel what?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Uh... Rifkin.","the-masseuse",73
"MICHAEL","Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.","the-masseuse",73
"MICHAEL","Guess you better keep on his good side.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Very funny. That's very funny.","the-masseuse",73
"JOANNE","I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.","the-masseuse",73
"MICHAEL","Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","But you like your Joel Rifkin.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Ask him to change it.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","You can't ask a person to change their name.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Why not?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Would you change yours?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. Eighteen strangles.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","I'll go.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","You think I should have asked George?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Karen?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh! The Risotto broad.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","I tought you didn't like double dates.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","And you're taking...","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Jody the masseuse.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Hey, did you get a massage yet?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","So what?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Well it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her: ""Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?""","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","That is so funny.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","(to Jody) You're listening to this?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Yeah. I heard you.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","(to George) So what did she say?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","You just said that you said it.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","(to Jerry) Can we go?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. Let's go.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","So soon? (they get up)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Yeah.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Nice meeting you Karen.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Oh yeah.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I strained my neck last night.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Really, how?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","So what's the deal with your friend George?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No deal. Why?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","What was all that ""attractive women not getting tickets"" nonsense?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","He was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Did you see the way that he was eating?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I have to tell you, I really don't like him.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","It's just I hate that type.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah, he's a bad seed.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So, what do you think?","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Really enjoyed it.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Jody's nice.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Yeah","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","You were *extremely* personable.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","I didn't pick up anything.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","The second time I sent the noodle back, I tought she made a face...","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","I didn't see a face.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I tought I saw a face.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Anyhow, what is the difference?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying: ""instead of the movie..."")","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","He he he he","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Ah ah ah ah","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So you think she likes me?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Massaging your neck.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Dion these days. What a cool name, Dion. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Dion.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Dion Benes?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Dion Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","D-Dion Rifkin?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Elaine! What is going on?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","She stayed over?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah. (disappointed)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","The sex wasn't so good?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No. The sex was fabulous.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I want the massage!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Did you ask her?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So we had a good time... the four of us.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","What did Jodi say?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","She had a good time.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Is that it?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Pretty much.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Did she say anything about, uh...","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","You just hesitated.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I was blowing on the coffee.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","She didn't like me?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So she doesn't like me?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","She said that?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yes.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","She told you she doesn't like me!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Yes.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","What were her exact--","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","""I don't like him.""","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Not everybody likes everybody!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","You were very nice!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","It has nothing to do with her sister.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","You vomited in 1987.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Oh no. That was the dry heaves.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Jodi.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Hey, Jerry.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like: it's so great to be all here)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What are you doing here?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I was giving Kramer a massage.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","No that's O.K.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","You don't know what you're missing buddy.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","So you had a good time.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Oh... yeah...","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Enjoyed yourself.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Very... much...","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","The massages are out!","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Wha--","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Ahh!!! They're out!","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Why?!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Don't you ever talk about her like that!","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","But why?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","That's final!!!","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Ah!!! Yahh!!!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh, you have photos in your wallet?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Yeah. Why? Is that weird?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","That's my mother.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","No, there's no resemblance.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah, there is, right here you see--","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Elaine, I was adopted.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(pause) Oh. That's nice.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","The game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.","the-masseuse",73
"TICKET MAN","Here it is. I need some I.D.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.","the-masseuse",73
"TICKET MAN","Well, I can't give it to you then.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Are you kidding me?","the-masseuse",73
"TICKET MAN","I'm afraid not.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.","the-masseuse",73
"TICKET MAN","I'm sorry. I need proof.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.","the-masseuse",73
"TICKET MAN","Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Where is a phone?","the-masseuse",73
"ANNOUNCER","Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Oh, God.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What's the matter with you?","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Jerry, I need another massage!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Oh please.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! It's killing me Jerry!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Well, did you get the ball?","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Oh I got the ball.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Well, It's quite a thrill.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Why don't you get somebody else?","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No ""if and's or but's"".","the-masseuse",73
"KRAMER","What about my massage?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Ask Newman.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Of course.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","What, do you think I've never had a massage before?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I wanna know what I did to this woman.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","What, you got a little thing for her?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Of course I support your decision to change your name.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Sure?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(she fakes a strangling) RRR...","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","O.K. you got your list?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Right.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","O.K.","the-masseuse",73
"O.K."," O.K.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","O.K. You start. What's your first choice?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Stuart.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(right away) No. Second choice.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Stu--Stuart's no good?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","I've never met a normal guy named Stuart.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","All right. Oh, Hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Great...","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Alex.","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","I gotta tell you, I have a bad association with the name Alex.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Bad bad association?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: ""Ahh!"". I mean every two seconds: ""Ahh!"". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: ""Ahh!"". I had to drop the class.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Hey.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Hi.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Hi. (kissing) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Ah, no problem. That's fine.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","What's with this music?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","What are you doing?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Actually, I should get a new one.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","No, I can't!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","You're going now?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I think I can still catch her.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","All right George. I have had just about enough of this.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","What? What are you talking about.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I know. I know.","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)","the-masseuse",73
"KAREN","Well, now *I* hate you!","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","That I'm used to. (he leaves)","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Ned?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","What is wrong with Ned?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Ellis.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Ellis and Alex aren't even close.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","NEXT!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Ohh, what is the point?","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","NO, NO. COME ON!","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","O.K. O.K. Remy.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?","the-masseuse",73
"ELAINE","Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.","the-masseuse",73
"JOEL","Grrrr!","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What do you mean, no?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","No means no.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Fine. Go.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What for?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","We need to talk.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","*You* need to talk?","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","We have nothing to talk about.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","What?","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","I can see that.","the-masseuse",73
"JODI","I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","Don't worry. (she leaves)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","You're a lucky guy.","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","I got to go after her.","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)","the-masseuse",73
"GEORGE","JODI! (he starts running after her)","the-masseuse",73
"THE END"," THE END","the-masseuse",73
"JERRY","You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","How would you describe the smell in this house?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","(sniffing) Dandruff?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","There's some kasha.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri,","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Alright, let's go, come on.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Wha... you're going?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Egh. These aren't candies.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Kramer. did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Well I'm a guest.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","You're not allowed to have people over?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","What, this is a party?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","(impatient) Come on!","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","What's the big rush?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","I'm having people over.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Who?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","(interested) Really?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","I'll put in a good word for you.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","(screaming) Aaahh!!","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","But Jerry, this is not coming out!","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Just put a coffee table book over it.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"ELAINE","Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Alright, we'll take the subway.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","There you go. That'll get you home in time.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","Oh! The subway? From Queens?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","I need something to read on the subway.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","(looks at it) TV Guide?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","I got history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"ELAINE","(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"ELAINE","How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"KRAMER","Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"KRAMER","Alright, but no bites.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"RICKY","Highlighter?","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"ELAINE","He's not my boyfriend.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"RICKY","He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Why?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"JERRY","Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"RICKY","(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEPETTO","They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"SYLVIA","Yeah, yeah. (to George, smiling) Is that your car out there?","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"SYLVIA","Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"GEORGE","Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.","the-cigar-store-indian",74
"SYLVIA","Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighbourhood.","the-cigar-store-indian",74

"JERRY","On your heart?","the-conversion",75
"ELAINE","Jerry, the man is a doctor.","the-conversion",75

"ELAINE","I think it would be romantic.","the-conversion",75
"GEORGE","Really?","the-conversion",75

"GEORGE","King Edward. King Edward, Jerry.","the-conversion",75
"JERRY","Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle","the-conversion",75

"ELAINE","Well I trust people not to do that.","the-conversion",75
"KRAMER","Big mistake.","the-conversion",75
"JERRY","Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?","the-conversion",75
"ELAINE","What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.","the-conversion",75
"JERRY","But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee-","the-conversion",75

"JERRY","It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","It's really cold.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Scary cold.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","That.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Huh, What is that, ha?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","What?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","When did you get that?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You can't even turn around in that thing.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Look at this (start hitting George)","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Hey George, can you feel this? (they are hitting his jacket)","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","What for?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Why?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Because it's rude, otherwise.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","The fabric of society is very complex George.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You can't bring Pepsi.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Because we're adults?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than Pepsi.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","All right, let's go. Who's driving?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","You are. I can't get that thing (George) in my car.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Give me a squeeze.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Get off of me. Get off of ME!","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice sectional.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Ring Dings?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a bakery.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I like Ring Dings.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON!","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is...","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Jerry.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Yeah, Jerry, come with me.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","All right","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side (mumble?) It's a wonderful thing isn't it?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I'm looking forward to it.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Love that Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah!","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Why?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You think it's effeminate?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","It's a tad dainty.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh, we forgot to pick a number.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You think I should go ask her for hers?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","No, forget it.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Just double park","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","No","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out of here?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give them up.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","It's a fallacy.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll be on.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Does the heater even work in this car?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","No.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I see.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","You see, ho ho,","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","But we were here ahead of you.","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","How do I know that?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Well we saw you come in.","the-dinner-party",77
"YYY","Well, that's easy for you to say.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","46?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","Yes.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","I'm on my way over there right now.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Me too.","the-dinner-party",77
"D","You're Jerry right?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","David!","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","Yes it is.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You know we were here ahead of you.","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","You're NOT getting my number.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Oh so you still don't believe us.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","47!","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","Us.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . I'll have the chocolate Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't have my wallet.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE",". . . Why not?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I never take it.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","So what do you do?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Oh, I get by.","the-dinner-party",77
"BARBARA","See you later (exits with the Bobka)","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","JERRY: See you later.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","That was our Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You can't beat a Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","We should have had that Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","They're going to be heroes.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole thing's useless.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Well how about a carrot cake?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Black Forrest?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","How about a Napoleon?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengle.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What's this one?","the-dinner-party",77

"CLERK","There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Well, we've got to get the cinnamon.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser Bobka - I think not.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","49?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","I'll have the cinnamon Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","... and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!","the-dinner-party",77
"CLECK","That will be 13.05","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","All right here you go.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","A hundred? I can't change that.","the-dinner-party",77

"KRAMER","You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should do an op-ed piece for the Times.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What is this?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","What?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","It's a hair.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Oh, take it back. Let's get another one.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Excuse me.","the-dinner-party",77
"MAN","Hey hey, I'm in line here.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a hair on it.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","You have to take a number.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) are you going to wait here?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","It was a little hair. I took it off.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What if it's your hair?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","What if it's your hair?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your roots out.","the-dinner-party",77

"JERRY","Well, why don't we just forget about the cake?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","No I'm bringing cake!","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true..."" (exits to street) "" A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive our new neighbor Linda was...""","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. Can you believe this?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","""...well of course I noticed it too with those ample breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out....""","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","No, no I can't comprehend it?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're basically still very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys who built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","How about Idi Amin?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Are those shoes comfortable?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","No not really.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","They look comfortable.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","No, out of the question.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Why?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What happened?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I'd rather not talk about it.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You can't tell me?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You found a hair in your Farina?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Yeah,","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What happened?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Wow. Who's hair was it?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","My mother's.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","68!","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","That's us.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Oh, good.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","(coughing and coughing)","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Ah, that's lovely.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Ah,","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your hair for some phlegm","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","Here you are.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","HEY DOUBLE-PARKER. SOVIET SCUM. COME ON OUT. IT'S FREEZING!","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Why?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","You know, Elaine.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","What about her?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE",". . . I'm a little scared of her.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","You're scared of Elaine?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Yes!","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Why?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","Because I wanted to look good for the party.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I wasn't talking to you.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Uh, wa?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What's the matter with you?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Uh, I don't feel so good.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","What's wrong?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","The black and white?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Not getting along?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I feel like I'm going to throw up.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Hey, what about your vomit streak?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Oh, oh!","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!... uh, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) Where're you going?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Fourteen years down the drain.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Do chickens have individual personalities?","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","(shivering) I don't care.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should be eating them. What's the matter with you?","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","Can I help you guys with anything?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. But my friend here has hypothermia.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I've got hypothermia.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","All right guys, take it outside.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","You're paying for these.","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","How was it?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","As good as it gets.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap Chardonnay.","the-dinner-party",77
"KRAMER","I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","Can I get you anything else?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Oh, no thanks.","the-dinner-party",77
"CLERK","How about a nice box of ""scram"".","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. What, what happened to you?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your ....","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are you drunk?","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","I had to give it to the liquor store guy.","the-dinner-party",77

"GEORGE","I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?","the-dinner-party",77
"ELAINE","Cinnamon Bobka.","the-dinner-party",77
"GEORGE","Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?","the-dinner-party",77
"JERRY","George!","the-dinner-party",77

"GEORGE","Whatever.","the-marine-biologist",78
"KRAMER","Well, what did you do next?","the-marine-biologist",78
"GEORGE","Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!","the-marine-biologist",78
"KRAMER","What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.","the-marine-biologist",78

"THE END"," THE END","the-marine-biologist",78
"AUDREY","Hum! That was really good!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Yeah. Are you full?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Oh no, I've had just enough.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","No thanks.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You're not gonna have any?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","No (with a disgusted face)","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Do you not like apple pie?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","No, it's not that.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Well, at least taste it.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","No (a resolute ""no"")","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You won't even taste it?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","No.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing ""no"") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on! (still shaking)","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Did she say why?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Maybe she's diabetic.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Maybe you said something that offended her.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Like at the airport? (getting excited)","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","That's a great idea!!!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Tell me about it!","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","We could be zipping all over the place.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","They could at least try it.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","They never try anything.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","What's the harm?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No harm!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Who wouldn't taste a pie?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Audrey.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Dump her.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You did?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","I got a pebble.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","What the hell does that mean?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","What? Why?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Do it. Do it. This.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Like... (doing it) Like this?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Oh yeah! It's you!","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","What's me?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Get out!","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...","the-pie",79
"JERRY","(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Real Boss!","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","I'm going down there.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","All right. All right. (They both leave)","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Keep it. (implied: please)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","It looks exactly like me.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","What's going on here? How do you think this happened?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","(european accent) You are perfect for that suit.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","You think so?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","I don't know.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","You really think this looks O.K. on me?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","I told you, I don't know.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","Why?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a 1200$ Gaultier dress.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","What is her problem?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","Yes.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","How did they get your face?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","And you waved it away.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Did you give her a reason?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","We certainly have.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Hey, Elaine scratch my back.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","No way!","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Come on, one lap around.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","No.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","It will be a funky adventure.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Kramer, forget it.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Jerry, how about you?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","I think you know my policy.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","I thought George was meeting us here?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","No he's going downtown to guard the suit.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","He's guarding a suit?","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","(to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","Turn around.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","(makes a guy trying the suit. His name is not mentionned but it seems to be Bob as it appears in the credits at the end of the episode.) It fits you perfectly.","the-pie",79
"BOB","You think so? (she nods and walks away)","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?","the-pie",79
"BOB","I'm buying the suit.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)","the-pie",79
"BOB","Excuse me, do you work here?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","(leaving the european accent) No.","the-pie",79
"BOB","Then what the hell business is it of yours?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.","the-pie",79
"BOB","Really? This Monday?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Yes. Now take off those pants.","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.","the-pie",79
"BOB","Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Everything is delicious.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You've tasted them?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Oh I see they have apple pie.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Mmm-hmm.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You've had the apple pie?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Many times.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Can we drop this?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Ah! Poppie.","the-pie",79
"POPPIE","Sweetheart, hello.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Poppie, this is Jerry.","the-pie",79

"POPPIE","Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Jerry are you OK?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Huh?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Is anything wrong?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","No, Nothing.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","You look like you've seen a ghost.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","(to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Hey. These are for you Olive.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","Thank you.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Ohh!","the-pie",79

"AUDREY","Jerry.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","So she tought I did it to get back at her","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Why didn't you just tell her?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","How could he not have washed?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Yeah, just like I do.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","We haven't spoken.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Olive?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Is that Elaine mannequin still there?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...","the-pie",79
"BOB","Where is it? Where is it?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.","the-pie",79
"BOB","You bastard! You hid the suit.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.","the-pie",79
"BOB","I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Hum... ok, what else you got?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Because you have an attitude.","the-pie",79
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Oh!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Georgio! Nice duds!","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Did you hear something?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Yeah, like a swoosh.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","So what? What would they care?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Audrey?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Was it apple?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","What else?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!","the-pie",79
"STRANGER","Do I know you?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Hmm... No you don't.","the-pie",79
"STRANGER","Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","The mannequin!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Oh, I got to see this thing.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","(to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Uh-huh","the-pie",79
"JERRY","The Charlie Macarthy hearings.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?","the-pie",79
"SALESWOMAN","I'm getting the manager. (she leaves)","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)","the-pie",79
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Just get the car!","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right?","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","Where are you going?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Poppie's","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No, I didn't hear anything.","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No, can't say as I did.","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","Kind of like a... rustling.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Could be the leaves...","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8:00. Bye-bye.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Hello.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","What are you doing here?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","So how was the pie?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","What pie?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","The apple pie you had today at Monks","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","I'm very busy here.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","You better not let Poppie see you here.","the-pie",79
"HEALTH INSPECTOR","All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","Uh, who are you?","the-pie",79
"HEALTH INSPECTOR","Board of health, we've had several complaints.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)","the-pie",79
"HEALTH INSPECTOR","Are you Poppie?","the-pie",79
"POPPIE","I'm Poppie.","the-pie",79
"HEALTH INSPECTOR","I think you'd better come with me.","the-pie",79
"POPPIE","What's the problem?","the-pie",79
"AUDREY","What do they want from Poppie?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.","the-pie",79
"WAITER","Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.","the-pie",79
"WAITER","(to George) The chef said that he made it special for you.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: it's Bob!)","the-pie",79
"MACKENZIE","Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing ""no"") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)","the-pie",79
"BUSINESSMAN","If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","So you didn't get the job.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","What am I supposed to say?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Tell her you lost your itch.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","What happened to your itch?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.","the-pie",79
"JERRY","Well you should tell her.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","What?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Uh, well, there's someone else.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","Someone else?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, yeah...","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","Who is she?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","her?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.","the-pie",79
"OLIVE","Why is she wearing her underwear?","the-pie",79
"KRAMER","Well, it's a style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.","the-pie",79
"GEORGE","Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?","the-pie",79
"JERRY","No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.","the-pie",79
"ELAINE","You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?","the-pie",79
"RICKY","TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.","the-pie",79
"THE END"," THE END","the-pie",79
"JERRY","The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a busguy starting to get going)","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","It's just not good, it's not good.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","It's not good.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Well at breakfast everybody reads.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","You read during lunch?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Ya","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Oh, well.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","There's nothing to talk about.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Ya, what's there to talk about.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","She knows there is nothing to talk about.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","At least you'll be talking.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Oh shut up.","the-stand-in",80
"AL","Hey, look who's here.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Hey, Al.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Hey, Al. How's it going?","the-stand-in",80
"AL","(extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.","the-stand-in",80
"AL","Great girl.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.","the-stand-in",80
"AL","(to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Ya.","the-stand-in",80
"AL","I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think he'd really like you to come visit.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Me?","the-stand-in",80
"AL","Ya, he said he could use a good laugh.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","What about me?","the-stand-in",80
"AL","(to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Ya","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Ya, see ya.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(points to George) Ya.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Oh, stop it.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","So you're not gonna come?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","No but say hello for me.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Hey!","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Hey! Hey Mick.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Hey Jerry.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","What's doing?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Nothing, what's doing with you?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Same old, same old.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","George this is Mickey.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Hi, nice to meet you.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Pleasure.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","How's work going you guys?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Lets not even talk about it.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(to Kramer) You got a job?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","How do you stop a kid from growing?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(to Mickey) What about lifts?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(to Kramer) Out of the question.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Easy Mickey, easy.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Yap..","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","All right we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","You wanna keep your job don't you?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Ya but..","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","YAH! No Buts","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Kramer","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.","the-stand-in",80
"FULTON","Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Who couldn't.","the-stand-in",80
"FULTON","I haven't cracked a smile in months.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.","the-stand-in",80
"FULTON","It's a fine time.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Oh, all right ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Eggs are eggs.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Daphne","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","(correcting George) Daphne.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","(interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","He told me not to get involved with you.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","What?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Is it true?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.","the-stand-in",80
"SON","How long are you going to be away for Daddy?","the-stand-in",80
"FATHER","I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.","the-stand-in",80
"SON","Don't go Daddy, don't go.","the-stand-in",80
"FATHER","Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.","the-stand-in",80
"DIRECTOR","(walks into the scene) ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Yo","the-stand-in",80
"STAGE HAND","All right you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Ah! (pauses for the hug) all right (Kramer still holding on) all right! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)","the-stand-in",80
"DIRECTOR","Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","How do those lifts feel?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Quiet.","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Hi guys.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Hey Tammy.","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","How about lunch?","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","OH I can't today, but um I see it our future. (starts to leave) See ya Kramer.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Ya.","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Bye Mickey","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","All of a sudden.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","What?","the-stand-in",80
"JOHNNY","Hey Mick.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","How you doin' Johnny?","the-stand-in",80
"JOHNNY","What gives...what's going on? Goin' out with Tammy?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Maybe. What's it to you?","the-stand-in",80
"JOHNNY","Somethin' different about you.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)","the-stand-in",80
"JOHNNY","Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.","the-stand-in",80
"JOHNNY","I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. (walking away) I'll find out.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Pachyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really, really, funny.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Hey Jerry.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Hey Phil how you doing?","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","You look terrific.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","I got my health.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(on the speaker) Ya","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Do I know him?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","If you were a woman would you go out with him?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. all right, give him my number.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","all right.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","What?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Ya. That's what she told me.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Why?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Is she?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Of course.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","So?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Maybe he likes her.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","So what are you gonna do?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Well I can't break up with her now.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Why?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Because he said I was going to.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Yes, I am.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Ya, I could see that.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","I don't see any way around it.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","No, me either.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","What choice do I have?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","None.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(yelling) Yes I told him the Pachyderm story!","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Maybe I outta go over there.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Towards what end?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Hey Mick.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","YAOH!","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","You (grabs Kramer)","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(starts pulling them apart) All right break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(pacing back and forth) Ya.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","I'm sorry Kramer.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","No no it's all right, it's all right. You're stressed Oout!","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","(whistles) What's he like huh?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","He's a good kid.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Ya?","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","So what does he care if you put lifts in?","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Why not?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","I thought we were going to spend the day together.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the Velcro ball. (laughs)","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","Yes, oh yes very much.","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Maybe you don't want to move in.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","No, no I do. You know it's just...","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","(interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! all right I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","(Phil cracking up) So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can barely hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","(dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","I know, I know, I was unbelievable","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Well this has been one hell of a night.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.","the-stand-in",80
"PHIL","Good night?","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week. It killed.

"ELAINE","Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","Just put it.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","He took it out.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","(confused) He what?","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","He took what out?","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","It.","the-stand-in",80

"JERRY","Out.","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","Out.","the-stand-in",80

"ELAINE","Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?","the-stand-in",80
"ELAINE","(to Kramer) He took it out.","the-stand-in",80
"KRAMER","Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","It.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","It.","the-stand-in",80

"JERRY","Well how long you are going to keep this up?","the-stand-in",80

"TAMMY","I don't think so.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Why not? What the hell are you talking about?","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm)","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","(recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda' lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Brewster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.","the-stand-in",80
"TAMMY","Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.","the-stand-in",80
"MICKEY","(in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!","the-stand-in",80

"FULTON","(still laughing and coughing) Stop.","the-stand-in",80
"JERRY","For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(happily) Difficult?","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","The other day, after work, some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...","the-stand-in",80
"GEORGE","(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.","the-stand-in",80
"DAPHNE","Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.","the-stand-in",80

"MERYL","I was not!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!","the-wife",81
"MERYL","By the way, you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, no, 12-8!","the-wife",81
"MERYL","No, it's 15-8.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Haven't worn this one in a long time.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Ooh, cashmere?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Alright, we'll stop over there.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Pancakes.","the-wife",81

"MERYL","I don't know that!  Mark's Michelle is a dog.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I'll get the short stack.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hey, is that my maple syrup? (Kramer hands it over.)","the-wife",81
"MERYL","You bring your own syrup?","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Got to.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","You got a lot to learn about pancakes.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...(gestures at the racks of clothes behind him.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Oh, wow.","the-wife",81

"JERRY","Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Sure, you get the discount, too.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I'm taking him to the cleaners!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Oh, hi Greg.","the-wife",81
"GREG","Haven't seen you in a while.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.","the-wife",81

"ELAINE","No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","Well, I gotta take off.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?","the-wife",81
"GREG","Eleven-thirty.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Eleven-thirty?","the-wife",81
"GREG","Wait, ten-thirty. Sorry.","the-wife",81

"JERRY","Adoring? What about handsome?","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I like adoring.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)","the-wife",81
"OWNER","Excuse me...where did you get that?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I, uh...well...","the-wife",81
"OWNER","Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Well, I told my wife not to bring it.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, just Meryl.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Why, why? Why does she get it?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds, and Jerry lets Elaine into the building - Jerry: Yeh? Elaine: Meh. Jerry: Eh.) And I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying ""my wife."" Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - ""my wife"" this, ""my wife"" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","""My wife has an inner ear infection.""","the-wife",81
"JERRY","See?","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Alright. (Elaine enters.)","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Let's make it fifty.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","The fly-boy.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","So?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Really.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Moisture?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah. Definite moisture.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","That's an open-lip kiss, alright.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Oh, uh...it's George.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Hey, what happened to you?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Nothing...little problem.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yeah, so?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah? What was it?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Here we go.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","You went...in the shower?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Do you go in the shower?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, never.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Do you?","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","I take baths.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Ever hear of...holding it in?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","How do you know?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Medical journals!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hello.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Oh, hi...honey.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","What are you doing here?","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I just thought I'd drop off a few things.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.)","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Jerry!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Uncle Leo!","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Hello!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hello.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Your wife?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yeah...my wife.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","What are you talking about?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Uh...I got married.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Well, it was sudden.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No, no, it was a small ceremony.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Haven't I always been a good uncle?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yes, yes, you have.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","Who told you when you went to school that you print well?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","You did, you did.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm a good printer.","the-wife",81
"UNCLE LEO","I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait! (Jerry tries to catch Leo before he runs off to tell him about his ""pretend marriage,"" but doesn't make it.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I can find out.","the-wife",81
"GREG","Would ya?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Sure. (Thinks - Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal!)","the-wife",81
"GREG","By the way, you look really great in that leotard.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Oh, thanks. (Thinks - That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","(Thinks - Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.) Um, you know Greg, I...","the-wife",81
"GREG","Can I have a sip of your water?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","(Thinks - Oh my God.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","I'm sorry, what were you saying?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","It was nothing, forget it. (George enters the gym.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too. (On the other side of the room, George falls off an exercise machine and gets his foot caught in it.)","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Honey? Could you get me something to drink?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","You're right there.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I didn't do anything with it.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","It's in the first drawer.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Yes, it is.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Did I say you were stupid?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Do you want me to go find it?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.","the-wife",81
"HELEN","Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?","the-wife",81
"MORTY","Why the hell didn't you tell us?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Listen, Ma...","the-wife",81
"MERYL","It was in here yesterday!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yeah, that's what I said!","the-wife",81
"HELEN","Who is she? When did this happen?","the-wife",81
"MORTY","I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.","the-wife",81
"HELEN","Morty, you're talking too loud.","the-wife",81
"MORTY","I'm not talking loud!","the-wife",81
"HELEN","You're hurting my eardrum.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Well, you must have done something with it!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm on the phone!","the-wife",81
"HELEN","Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Mom, I'm not married.","the-wife",81
"HELEN","What?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm not married!","the-wife",81
"MORTY","I knew it, I told ya!","the-wife",81
"HELEN","Uncle Leo said.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.","the-wife",81
"HELEN","A discount on dry-cleaning?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Well, I give up.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Got any coffee?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Yeah, me too. Love you.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Love you.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Well, goodnight.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","So what do you want me to do?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Talk to him!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","How can I do that?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Well, that doesn't mean anything!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Bottle-wipe supercedes it.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Why?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I...I don't know...","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","No, that's not it!","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Why couldn't you just wait?","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","I was there! I saw a drain!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Since when is a drain a toilet?!","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","It's all pipes! What's the difference?!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Okay! Okay! I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Alright.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Well, you gotta pick it up for me!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","I'm so tired!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Boy, you don't look good.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Huh? I don't?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","No, you look pale.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...","the-wife",81
"MARTY","I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.)","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Maybe.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Alright, I'm gonna see you later.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Where you goin'?","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.","the-wife",81
"KRAMER","Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm goin' home. (Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her and waits by the door.)","the-wife",81
"PAULA","Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Oh, about thirteen dollars.","the-wife",81
"PAULA","Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Well, I'm sorry.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Hi, Greg.","the-wife",81
"GREG","Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","What happened? Did he bring it up?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","Signal? What signal?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah! It's a social thing.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","No! I won't be a party to this.","the-wife",81
"GEORGE","So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)","the-wife",81
"PAULA","I won't let you do this!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I want to!","the-wife",81
"PAULA","But it isn't right! I can't.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Give me the clothes.","the-wife",81
"PAULA","Jerry, please. What about her?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)","the-wife",81
"PAULA","No, Jerry, please!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.","the-wife",81
"PAULA","I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Do you want box or hanger?","the-wife",81
"PAULA","You decide. (Jerry considers.)","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?","the-wife",81
"GREG","Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Are you sure you want to do that?","the-wife",81
"GREG","Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","Very.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)","the-wife",81
"GREG","Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.","the-wife",81
"GREG","Why?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?","the-wife",81
"GREG","Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?","the-wife",81
"ELAINE","Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.","the-wife",81
"MARTY","Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)","the-wife",81
"ANNA","That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.)","the-wife",81
"MERYL","You son of a bitch!","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'm sorry.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Who is she? I want to know who she is.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","Yes, that's right.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","What happened to us, Jerry?","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I'll tell you what happened. We got married.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","I'm sorry, this is my fault. I pushed it on you.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","It's alright, I want you to have it.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Okay, thanks.","the-wife",81
"JERRY","We'll always have...pancakes.","the-wife",81
"MERYL","Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)","the-wife",81
"GRANDPA","I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!","the-wife",81
"THE END"," THE END","the-wife",81
"JERRY","I really feel as human beings, we need more training in our basic social skills. Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","You know their timing couldn't be worse.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","When are they leaving for Paris?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Not for another three days.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","What about her place?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","She lives with her parents.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","The baldies","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Hey Alec","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Hey Alec","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","This is Joey.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Hey Joey, how you doin'?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","(Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Well uh....","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JOEY","(interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JOEY","Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","What happened?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Ya, it's much better isn't it?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Oh, n-no comparison.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","What?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Your parents are going to Paris right?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Yea?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","What about little Joey?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Who?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Ah, I think he's probably better off.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","But there are no stamps on these.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Why are you doing this?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Why?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"MORTY","Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Well I suppose the children do.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"HELEN","Since always. We've never liked them.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Why?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JERRY","I don't know.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","What is that?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Maybe he was just trying to be nice.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"GEORGE","That's what I wanna know.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"GEORGE","They said tomorrow, maybe.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","Maybe?","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"FRANK","Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","Ah keep quiet.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I don't know what the reason could be.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Aaron is quite the tour guide.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Oh sure like Monet.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I say the guy was painting without his glasses.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"KRAMER","You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","(Laughing) Well see you later.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","(leaving) Bye","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Bye","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","We have no plans.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","(noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Now what is Executive?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Why would they? Nobody bought them then.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","He's wearing one.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","You gotta deal.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Yaaaa.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","He'll send them express.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","You're crazy.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","N-na I'm paying for the trip.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","So much the better.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","Paris huh?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","Where will you stay?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Fantastic?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","How gee what a coincidence.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ALEC","And you'll send me a postcard.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Mm hmm.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Aaron","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","Yes?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","No, it was fun.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"AARON","Yea, they bought me a coke.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","How serendipitous.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Mmm","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Did you call Jack Klompus yet?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Ah come on.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","No I haven't seen it yet.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Oh you have to go you have to","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","I'm going","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JACK","Ya","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","It's Morty","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","Who died?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","What boxes?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I'm gonna explain what boxes.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","Alright how the hell do I know?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","I thought you're going to Paris","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","What's in the boxes?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Raincoats.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JACK","When do you want these?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Send them tomorrow.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","You think they're coming tonight?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I dunno they said maybe.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","Well they better come, I got all this Paella.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I-I wasn't in the attic.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","I heard noise.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Maybe it was a mouse.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","What?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","I will not tolerate infestation.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","You haven't even seen one.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"FRANK","Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","All right Frank that's enough.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Uh huh.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","They will get a good home won't they?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Yea I'm in a good mood here.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Thank you.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Hey, George what are you doing here?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Oh, I gotcha (clicks)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","(leaving) That'll do.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Hey that's swell.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Dinner? (grabs Kramer)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Ya.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","You had dinner with the Seinfelds?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Yea, last night.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Was this something you had planned for a while?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"RUDY","Sure that's the Executive.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Ya, you have any others?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Very interested","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Well bring 'em in.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","So you'll buy them?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","I don't see what would possibly stop me.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"RUDY","Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"GEORGE","I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Payaya, ya I'll be there.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"MORTY","You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Well he told you about the place.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","You find something you get a fee.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"MORTY","What leg work?","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"MORTY","If anything you're getting too much.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Too much?!","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","That's right, they're my coats.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Look I want thirty-five percent.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","I'm thinking more like fifteen.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","No way I'm taking fifteen.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Well you're not getting thirty-five.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Ok it's a deal","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"RUDY","Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"RUDY","I burned 'em.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"GEORGE","Oh. That's good.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","It is a tad askew.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","I've hardly been out to dinner with them.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","You're right he's insane.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","So what are you going to do?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JERRY","Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JERRY","I was kind of um (pauses) making out.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","During Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Hello Mrs. Seinfeld","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Wondering what?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Well we already saw it.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","I'm afraid I don't.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","What?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","Jerry sends his laundry out.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","How could you?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","How could I what?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","You were making out during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","What? No.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MORTY","Don't lie Jerry.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(turns) Newman.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"HELEN","How could you do such a thing?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","(answering the phone) Hello.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"DORIS","(off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JERRY","Why what did I do?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"MR. GOLDSTEIN","(Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Rachel!","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"JERRY","Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","(sighs) So how about that Aaron?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","Whew","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ELAINE","You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"JERRY","No I hadn't noticed.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"NEWMAN","(at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.","the-raincoats-part-1",82

"FRANK","I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"ESTELLE","Ah forget about them let's just...","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"THE END"," THE END","the-raincoats-part-1",82
"KRAMER","So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","How serendipitous.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Mmm","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Did you call Jack Klompus yet?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","What boxes?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","I'm gonna explain what boxes.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","Alright how the hell do I know?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","What's in the boxes?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Raincoats.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"HELEN","I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","When do you want these?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"FRANK","I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ESTELLE","Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","I-I wasn't in the attic.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ESTELLE","I heard noise.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"FRANK","(jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","What?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"FRANK","I will not tolerate infestation.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"FRANK","Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ESTELLE","All right Frank that's enough.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Uh huh.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","They will get a good home won't they?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"GEORGE","Dinner? (grabs Kramer)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Ya.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","You had dinner with the Seinfelds?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Yea, last night.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Was this something you had planned for a while?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"KRAMER","Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Sure that's the Executive.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Ya, you have any others?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Very interested","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Well bring 'em in.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"JERRY","Look I don't know.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","That's right.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Is there something wrong with my parents?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"JERRY","Look I really don't know what they're plans are.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","What is that anyway?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","It's a Spanish dish. It's a mlange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"GEORGE","Hey could you do one other thing for me?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Name it.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smiles) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","(pause) All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"JERRY","Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"RUDY","Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"GEORGE","I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Payaya, ya I'll be there.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"KRAMER","That's right","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","He's ripping you off","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Well he told you about the place.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","You find something you get a fee.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Well it's too late now.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","Ya so have I","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","What leg work?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","If anything you're getting too much.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Too much?!","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","That's right, they're my coats.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Look I want thirty-five percent.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","I'm thinking more like fifteen.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","No way I'm taking fifteen.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Well you're not getting thirty-five.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"KRAMER","Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Ok it's a deal","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"GEORGE","So uh where are the clothes?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"RUDY","I burned 'em.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"GEORGE","Oh. That's good.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","It is a tad askew.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","I've hardly been out to dinner with them.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","You're right he's insane.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","So what are you going to do?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Ya what do you mean from what you saw?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Yea why not?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","I was kind of um (pauses) making out.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","During Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Hello Mrs. Seinfeld","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Wondering what?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Well we already saw it.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","(getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","I'm afraid I don't.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","What?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Jerry sends his laundry out.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"NEWMAN","(laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","How could you?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","How could I what?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","You were making out during Schindler's List?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","What? No.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Don't lie Jerry.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","(turns) Newman.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","How could you do such a thing?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","(answering the phone) Hello.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","You broke the window?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","He broke the window?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"DORIS","(off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"MORTY","So what did you do about the window?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JACK","I gotta fix your window now?","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"HELEN","We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","Some place else? What about Paris?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MORTY","You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"HELEN","I think you're out of your mind.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"FRANK","I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"JERRY","Why what did I do?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"MR. GOLDSTEIN","(Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Rachel!","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"ELAINE","Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","(sighs) So how about that Aaron?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","Whew","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"ELAINE","You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","No I hadn't noticed.","the-raincoats-part-2",83

"ESTELLE","Ah forget about them let's just...","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"THE END"," THE END","the-raincoats-part-2",83
"JERRY","To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'","the-fire",84
"TOBY","These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, really great.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","A coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","It was there!","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","'And that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from ""The Price Is Right""! (demonstrates)","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.""","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","You don't know? Come on, that's gold!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know about ""gold.""","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Oh, that's gold, baby.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I was saying 'baby' way before George!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, who's he?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly. I would like to have a good show.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Danke schoen, my little dumplings.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Hey, how about that Toby, huh?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, how about her?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Ooh, she's a package full of energy!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, she's a package full of something.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Hey, are you performing tomorrow night?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.","the-fire",84

"ELAINE","Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Is that the waitress from the comedy club?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","She's got a kid?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","Do you think 25 kids is too much?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets.","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney?","the-fire",84
"KID","No Barney!","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","Maybe a clown.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","How about Bozo?","the-fire",84
"KID","Who's Bozo?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","George...","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","George...","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","And the TV show! He had cartoons!","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...","the-fire",84
"FRANK","Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!","the-fire",84
"ESTELLE","Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Hi!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Hi, Toby.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","How are you doing today?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Nope.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Really!","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Maybe it'll be you!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Oh...well...","the-fire",84
"TOBY","You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Well! Well, it could be you.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","No...","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","No, really.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Really? You think so?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Sure.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","I mean, stranger things have happened...","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Hey, Ronnie. (To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?","the-fire",84

"RONNIE","You know Leonard Christian's here?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, I know.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I don't...think so.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I don't...I dunno.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Is it possible for nostrils to expand?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Oh, is this a bit?","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","You are so funny!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","What about me?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Good, good.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","So, you up next?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, really! Really! That is so true!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.","the-fire",84
"TV."," TV.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)","the-fire",84
"JERRY","See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, that is so true, yes!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","...that's why men hunt and women nest.","the-fire",84
"TOBY","BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Look, she didn't mean anything.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Hey! What is wrong with you?!","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Me? Nothing's wrong with me.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Oh, I can take it.","the-fire",84

"ERIC","No!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?","the-fire",84
"ERIC","I don't know, I just don't.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?","the-fire",84
"ERIC","Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?","the-fire",84
"ERIC","Well, what is he?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Yes, he's a clown!","the-fire",84
"ERIC","Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Alright, just forget it.","the-fire",84
"ERIC","Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","Hi Mom, how's everything?","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","The burgers should be ready in a minute.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)","the-fire",84
"ERIC","There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.)","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","But you yelled ""get out of my way""!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?","the-fire",84
"FIREMAN","How do you live with yourself?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Its not easy.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","So she doesn't want to see me anymore.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","No, her too. And her mother.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Really? Her mother.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","To some degree.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","In a manner of speaking.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, it's honest.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Perhaps.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) ""Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, right.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, that'd be something.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","I'm not kidding, you should do it.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Well, go ahead! Do it!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Why can't I?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","No reason!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","This is unprecedented!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","There's no precedent, baby!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","What...are you using my babies now?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'","the-fire",84
"TOBY","You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Well, how would you like it if I called security?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","What did you go up there to heckle her for?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","What accident?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","That's unbelievable!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You ran?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.""","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Holy cow!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - "" (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","How could you do that?!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You're Batman.","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","You kept makin' all the stops?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Well, people kept ringin' the bell!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","You did all this...for a pinky toe?","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Well, it's a valuable appendage.","the-fire",84
"JOANNE","So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Really.","the-fire",84
"JOANNE","Poor kid. What an ordeal.","the-fire",84
"MICHAEL","And you know how extremely sensitive she is...she's gonna need our full support.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yeah, right.","the-fire",84
"MICHAEL","Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?","the-fire",84
"TOBY","Oh no, I'll be fine...","the-fire",84
"JERRY","She got the promotion?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yep.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Why?","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Too bad.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Why don't you just shut the f-","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Oh, wonderful!","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.","the-fire",84
"ELAINE","Oh, of course! She's deranged.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Yeah, well, won't be long.","the-fire",84
"ANNOUNCER","Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","Gotta go. (heads out on stage)","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Robin? Robin!","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","George, what is it? I'm working.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","What are you talking about?","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need ""the clown"" in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","Alright, but I'm serious about this.","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Alright, hand it over man!","the-fire",84
"JERRY","...that's why men hunt and women nest.","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","He's got a gun! He's got a gun! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)","the-fire",84
"ROBIN","George! This is Ronnie Kaye!","the-fire",84
"GEORGE","The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?","the-fire",84
"RONNIE","Nostrils.","the-fire",84
"JERRY","George - could I have a word?","the-fire",84
"JERRY","I was in a hotel the other day, and on the back of the door in the hotel they have the fire map. I'm flattered that they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'","the-fire",84
"THE END"," THE END","the-fire",84
"KRAMER","All right, get off at the next exit.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the exit.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Didn't they just have a baby?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Put that on the top of your list.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","When's Rachel comin' out?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","She's makin' the three o'clock train.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","I bought him some kishka.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","What's that?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","Me too. I love cough medicine.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","What's your favorite?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","No.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","Are we almost there?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","What for?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Come on, I'll rub some on yours.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","I don't think so.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No thanks.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","And then there's Mog. (She sits down next to Jerry)","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No lines.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","You know why? One word: shade.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","What?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Jane's topless. (They all look)","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Yo yo ma.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Boutros Boutros-Ghali.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh, in a minute, Carol.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","We're gonna be right there.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","What?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No thanks.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I'm good.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin'","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Ugghh.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Is she gorgeous? (Elaine + Jerry looking away)","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Oh, gorgeous, yes.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","So very gorgeous.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit)","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Oh, you have to lie.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","It's a must lie situation.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Yes, it's a must lie situation.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","No, I don't think so.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You know, we might want to tell Kramer.","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Oh this ointment should do it.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine!","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Elaine, you have children?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Yeah, see ya.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Okay. (He leaves)","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Oh, just look at him!","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Hey Rachel!","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","What kind of a greeting was that?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","She's got greeting problems.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You got lobster for everybody?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You saw who, what?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You saw Jane topless?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Oh you mean face down on her chest.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Face up on her back?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well why'd she do that?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","I guess she was hot.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You mean she just laid there topless?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","No, no, she got up, walked around...","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Walked around? And you looked?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I can't believe it, you saw her before me.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well, how good a look did you get?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Well what'd you mean?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","I guess that's true...","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You can see me naked. I can offer you that.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","I've never been called breathtaking either.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","How are you gonna do that?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I can be very clever.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","I'm gonna take a swim.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Hey!","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Oh, sorry.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Don't you knock?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You might have.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I didn't.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You won't.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","What'd you want anyway, George?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","We don't have any gum.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Strange man.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Wait'll you get to know him.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","So where is this baby, anyway?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I was in the pool! I was in the pool!","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Did she do it on purpose?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","So what?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","But...","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh... You mean... shrinkage.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yes. Significant shrinkage!","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","So you feel you were short changed.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Well, so what's the difference?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","What if she discusses it with Jane?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","How do you know?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Women aren't like us.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking down","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","What do you mean, like laundry?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","No.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","It shrinks?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Like a frightened turtle!","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Why does it shrink?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","It just does.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","You mean you've never tasted lobster?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","No.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","I'm gonna get him.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","It's nothing, George.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","What is it with you?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","(To George) Easy big fella.","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","No, I got 'em in the ocean.","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","The ocean? What'd you mean?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","(Entering with baby) Here he is.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby)","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Some night, huh?","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Some dinner, huh?","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Nothing like fresh caught lobster.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Some house, huh?","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","It was built by Mark Farman.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Some ugly baby, huh?","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","What did you say?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","I said, uh, some snuggly baby.","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","He is something.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You told her?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Yeah, what's the big deal?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","You're going back to New York now?","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","Yeah, I have some things to do.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel,","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","So what if I did?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","I don't know what you're talking about.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all","the-hamptons",85
"JANE","I'm sure it is.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Looking for this? (Holding up lobster)","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Oh, Kramer! You startled me.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Well, I thought you might wind up around here.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","I'm afraid I couldn't do that.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Why not?","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Well, that wouldn't be kosher.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Come on, Kramer.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Heyahhh!","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","I just heard a car drive out. What was that?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the","the-hamptons",85
"CAROL","George, thanks so much for making breakfast.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","I didn't know you could cook.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.","the-hamptons",85
"BEN","Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (Rachel","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Good morning.","the-hamptons",85
"ALL","Hey, hey.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","What happened?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","You'd regret it for the rest of your life.","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","You're right, I would have.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","A little breakfast.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Yes, I do, thanks.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Umm... This is so good.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Ah, enjoying them?","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Mm-hmm.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","There's lobster in these eggs?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Well, I guess I gotta go, too.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","Excuse me?","the-hamptons",85
"POLICE","I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster","the-hamptons",85
"KRAMER","Wonder what's goin' on.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.","the-hamptons",85
"MICHAEL","There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer","the-hamptons",85
"RACHEL","Ahh! Don't you ever knock?","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael to town.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","They got some sort of program.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","Hey, isn't that Michael's car?","the-hamptons",85
"ELAINE","There's Rachel.","the-hamptons",85
"GEORGE","Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)","the-hamptons",85
"THE END"," THE END","the-hamptons",85
"JERRY","It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, the existence of men and their","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","To your promotion.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you","the-opposite",86
"MR LIPPMAN","Well, you're really on your way now.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","You really oughtta do something about that cold.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","You got a raise?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","I don't fool around, baby!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Oh, when did that happen?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","They're signing the papers next week.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange looks )","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Oh, the beach.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","What is it that isn't working?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.","the-opposite",86
"WAITRESS","Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Good for the tuna.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","So what? What am I supposed to do?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Go talk to her.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","I'm Victoria. Hi.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","What's happening?","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","The coffee table book. It's a go!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Oh yeah, I heard all about it.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Oh, you better believe it!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","I'll loan you my puffy shirt.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","No,no,no.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","What're you gonna talk about?","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Well, coffee tables.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","You know who you are? Even Steven","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","Are you growing a beard?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Why shave every day? It just grows right back.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","I guess ...","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","That won't be necessary.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.","the-opposite",86
"VICTORIA","Who are you, George Costanza?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.","the-opposite",86
"THEATER MANAGER","Excuse me, is your name Elaine?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yes.","the-opposite",86
"THEATER MANAGER","Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-opposite",86
"THEATER MANAGER","Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","An accident? What happened?","the-opposite",86
"THEATER MANAGER","He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Oh. Ok. Thank you.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","( With her mouth full of Jujyfruit ) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","You want one?","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","No thanks.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","Where did you get those?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","At the movies.","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah, he did.","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","Then when did you get those?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Right after ... that ...","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Well... the counter...was right there, and...","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","No, no, it does!","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","But...Jake...","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","I would like to be alone now, please.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","But, Jake, I didn't...","the-opposite",86
"JAKE","Goodnight!","the-opposite",86

"KATHY LEE","I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!","the-opposite",86
"REGIS","Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this is a true story. I was skiing at the time.","the-opposite",86
"REGIS","You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, and you're writing books!","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!","the-opposite",86
"KATHY LEE","Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.","the-opposite",86
"KATHY LEE","Is that fabulous?","the-opposite",86
"REGIS","Look at this!","the-opposite",86
"KATHY LEE","Is that fabulous?","the-opposite",86

"ELAINE","Yeah, it got pretty nasty.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Why didn't you eat it in the cab?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","What's all this?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Played cards last night.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Oh yeah? How'd you do?","the-opposite",86

"ELAINE","You always break even.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!","the-opposite",86

"GEORGE","Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Elaine ... look! A twenty!","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Oh my God.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Hey boss.","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","Kramer. Come in.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian )","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","Have a seat.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","What, have you got yourself a cold?","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your appearance on ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and -","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","It was pretty good, huh?","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Because of the coffee thing?","the-opposite",86
"MR.LIPPMAN","Kramer, I'm sorry.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","It's out -","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","Kramer, I -","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","Why don't you tell me about some of your previous job experiences?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","Go on.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","Do you talk to everybody like this?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Of course.","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","My niece told me you were different.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I am different, yeah.","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.","the-opposite",86
"MR. CUSHMAN","Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.","the-opposite",86
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Nice to meet you.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!","the-opposite",86
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Hire this man!","the-opposite",86
"SECRETARY","Tina Robbins is here to see you.","the-opposite",86
"MAN","Who's that?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, but I've been sub-","the-opposite",86
"MAN","Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey.","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Please.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Hi Tina.","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Hi Elaine.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","So, I haven't seen you in a while.","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Elaine, we have a problem.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Well, what is it?","the-opposite",86
"TINA","You're getting kicked out.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Kicked out?! Why?!","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Well, there's been a number of complaints.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah? Like what?","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","I didn't know who he was!","the-opposite",86
"TINA","That's why there's a buzzer.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","What else?","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","What else have you got?","the-opposite",86
"TINA","Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","I suppose...","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","Jerry ...","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Yes?","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","I've been doing a lot of thinking.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Aha?","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Oh, that's okay.","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","What?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","You will?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Sure. See, things always even out for me.","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","Huh?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!","the-opposite",86
"RACHEL","Yeah, you too.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","The New York Yankees?!","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","The New York Yankees!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","I can't believe it.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","That's a great place!","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I'm back in business, baby!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Hi Elaine.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","How're things going?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Why? Why are they doing that?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","I don't know! They have a list of grievances.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","The jewel thief?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Yeah, the jewel thief.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","What else?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Well, you could move in with my parents.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between her fingers )","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Instinct.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead )","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?","the-opposite",86
"SECRETARY","Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.","the-opposite",86
"MR. LIPPMAN","Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.","the-opposite",86
"INTERPRETER","Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.","the-opposite",86
"MR LIPPMAN","I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Is that the end of it?","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Yeah, it's the last one.","the-opposite",86
"ESTELLE","I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Oh, it's true.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Alright, let's go.","the-opposite",86
"FRANK","Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps G's forehead )","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.","the-opposite",86
"ESTELLE","Jerry, did you hear this?","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","He knows what he's doing.","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Opposite.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Why'd you have to eat so many?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose?","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Don't say that.","the-opposite",86
"ELAINE","It's true. I'm George! I'm George!","the-opposite",86
"GEORGE","Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! ( Sits down, says to waitress:)","the-opposite",86
"KRAMER","Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Ah ... let's call it even.","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee.","the-opposite",86
"THE END"," THE END","the-opposite",86
"JERRY","It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, the existence of men and their","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","To your promotion.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you","the-chaperone",87
"MR LIPPMAN","Well, you're really on your way now.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","You really oughtta do something about that cold.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","You got a raise?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","I don't fool around, baby!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Oh, when did that happen?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","They're signing the papers next week.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange looks )","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Oh, the beach.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","What is it that isn't working?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.","the-chaperone",87
"WAITRESS","Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Good for the tuna.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","So what? What am I supposed to do?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Go talk to her.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","I'm Victoria. Hi.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","What's happening?","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","The coffee table book. It's a go!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Oh yeah, I heard all about it.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Oh, you better believe it!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","I'll loan you my puffy shirt.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","No,no,no.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","What're you gonna talk about?","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Well, coffee tables.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","You know who you are? Even Steven","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","Are you growing a beard?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Why shave every day? It just grows right back.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","I guess ...","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","That won't be necessary.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.","the-chaperone",87
"VICTORIA","Who are you, George Costanza?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.","the-chaperone",87
"THEATER MANAGER","Excuse me, is your name Elaine?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yes.","the-chaperone",87
"THEATER MANAGER","Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-chaperone",87
"THEATER MANAGER","Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","An accident? What happened?","the-chaperone",87
"THEATER MANAGER","He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Oh. Ok. Thank you.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","( With her mouth full of Jujyfruit ) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","You want one?","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","No thanks.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","Where did you get those?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","At the movies.","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah, he did.","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","Then when did you get those?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Right after ... that ...","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Well... the counter...was right there, and...","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","No, no, it does!","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","But...Jake...","the-chaperone",87
"JAKE","I would like to be alone now, please.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","But, Jake, I didn't...","the-chaperone",87

"KATHY LEE","I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!","the-chaperone",87
"REGIS","Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this is a true story. I was skiing at the time.","the-chaperone",87
"REGIS","You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, and you're writing books!","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!","the-chaperone",87
"KATHY LEE","Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.","the-chaperone",87
"KATHY LEE","Is that fabulous?","the-chaperone",87
"REGIS","Look at this!","the-chaperone",87

"ELAINE","Yeah, it got pretty nasty.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Why didn't you eat it in the cab?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","What's all this?","the-chaperone",87

"ELAINE","You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -","the-chaperone",87

"GEORGE","Day was -","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Night.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yes!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","So you just did the opposite of everything?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Elaine ... look! A twenty!","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Oh my God.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Hey boss.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","Kramer. Come in.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian )","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","Have a seat.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","What, have you got yourself a cold?","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your appearance on ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and -","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","It was pretty good, huh?","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Because of the coffee thing?","the-chaperone",87
"MR.LIPPMAN","Kramer, I'm sorry.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","It's out -","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","Kramer, I -","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","Why don't you tell me about some of your previous job experiences?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","Go on.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","Do you talk to everybody like this?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Of course.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","My niece told me you were different.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I am different, yeah.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. CUSHMAN","Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Nice to meet you.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!","the-chaperone",87
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Hire this man!","the-chaperone",87
"SECRETARY","Tina Robbins is here to see you.","the-chaperone",87
"MAN","Who's that?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, but I've been sub-","the-chaperone",87
"MAN","Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey.","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Please.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Hi Tina.","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Hi Elaine.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","So, I haven't seen you in a while.","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Elaine, we have a problem.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Well, what is it?","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","You're getting kicked out.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Kicked out?! Why?!","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Well, there's been a number of complaints.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah? Like what?","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","I didn't know who he was!","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","That's why there's a buzzer.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","What else?","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","What else have you got?","the-chaperone",87
"TINA","Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","I suppose...","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","Jerry ...","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Yes?","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","I've been doing a lot of thinking.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Aha?","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Oh, that's okay.","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","What?","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","You will?","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Sure. See, things always even out for me.","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","Huh?","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!","the-chaperone",87
"RACHEL","Yeah, you too.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","The New York Yankees?!","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","The New York Yankees!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","I can't believe it.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","That's a great place!","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I'm back in business, baby!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Hi Elaine.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","How're things going?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Why? Why are they doing that?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","I don't know! They have a list of grievances.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","The jewel thief?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Yeah, the jewel thief.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","What else?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Well, you could move in with my parents.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between her fingers )","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Instinct.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead )","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?","the-chaperone",87
"SECRETARY","Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.","the-chaperone",87
"MR. LIPPMAN","Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.","the-chaperone",87
"INTERPRETER","Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.","the-chaperone",87
"MR LIPPMAN","I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Is that the end of it?","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Yeah, it's the last one.","the-chaperone",87
"ESTELLE","I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Oh, it's true.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Alright, let's go.","the-chaperone",87
"FRANK","Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps G's forehead )","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.","the-chaperone",87
"ESTELLE","Jerry, did you hear this?","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","He knows what he's doing.","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Opposite.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Why'd you have to eat so many?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose?","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Don't say that.","the-chaperone",87
"ELAINE","It's true. I'm George! I'm George!","the-chaperone",87
"GEORGE","Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! ( Sits down, says to waitress:)","the-chaperone",87
"KRAMER","Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Ah ... let's call it even.","the-chaperone",87
"JERRY","Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee.","the-chaperone",87
"THE END"," THE END","the-chaperone",87
"STATIONER","May I help you?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000.","the-big-salad",88

"ELAINE","Well, it's for my boss.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","What do you do?","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Elaine.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Elaine, . . . and your last name?","the-big-salad",88

"GEORGE","Hey, wanna get some lunch?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Just had a big bowl of Kix.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Ah, no.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Please come, Elaine.","the-big-salad",88

"GEORGE","(???), we'll see you in a little while.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Maybe I should just get married.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","You can say that again.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Good for you.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Right on baby. (???)","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What was that?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Who Gendason?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Steve Gendason.","the-big-salad",88
".ELAINE","Why is that name familiar?","the-big-salad",88
"HX","He used to be a baseball player.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","So what?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Certainly are.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","All right. You're in MY face.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","I still don't see what the big deal is.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Although at times can be rather pedantic.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","No, no. I'd like to take you out.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Okay, thanks, George.","the-big-salad",88
"WX","Here's your big salad to go.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Oh, thank you.","the-big-salad",88

"JULIE","Here's your big salad.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Thank you, Julie.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Sure, George.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Ya, you go.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Bye bye","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Did you see what just happened?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, that all depends. . .","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Yeah, so?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Is that a fact?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No it isn't.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","I mean I'm the one who bought it.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Yes you did.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","You think she should have said something?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","She could have.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Oh, I know.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Obviously.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Turn on the TV.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","I'm puttin it on...","the-big-salad",88
"TV",". . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Jerry . . .","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, it has nothing to do with you.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","I like Julie. She's very personable.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Yeah, she's very lovely.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","That's great George.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","So did you enjoy your lunch?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Even though what?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE",". . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","What? What are you trying to say, George?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","You want the money for the big salad, George?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","No, no,","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","What is the problem?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Ah, no , I don't think so.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Why not?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Who is staring?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hello Newman.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, no I don't. Why?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","You know, Genderson. This is something big.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","I suppose.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","What did Kramer say?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","I don't know. Nothing.?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?","the-big-salad",88

"JERRY",". . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Just a few times.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Why?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","I liked him.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","You liked, Newman?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","He ended it.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY",". . . HE ended it?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, no of course not.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What tee?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Newman! She went out with Newman!","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","It must be a mistake.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, there's less.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","It's possible.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.","the-big-salad",88
"WX","Would you like some more coffee?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No,, but thank you.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Ugh! You are kidding me.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","To please Mr. Pitt.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Uh, great!","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hi Julie.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hi.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Hi Julie.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","How do you know THAT?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Who is it.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","It's Jerry.","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Noit your type?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Not really.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Well, how come?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Ah, she just didn't do it for me.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What, what is wrong with her?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","You don't think she's attractive?","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Care for some lemonade?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, thank you.","the-big-salad",88
"NEWMAN","Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What are you so worried about this for?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","He did?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","So it had nothing to do with you.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","No, I don't think so.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Oh, I love curls.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Yeah,, me too.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","All right, I'll see you later.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Where you going?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Genderson's.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","You're going to see Genderson?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","It's weighing on my conscience.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","A ha! We're just friends.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Oh, share.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","Well, she probably just assumed.","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","Um, did she?","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE",". . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","That's what I'm suggesting.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE",". . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?","the-big-salad",88
"JULIE","George, all I did was hand someone a bag.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Really? A fight with the foreman?","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Yes.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.","the-big-salad",88
"STATIONER","Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Okay.","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","You had how many dates with him? Three?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Around three. I don't know.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","And . .","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","What? I'm not looking. Nothing.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Why are you looking at my face?","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Where am I going to look?","the-big-salad",88
"MARGARET","Kiss me.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY",". . . I can't.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Newman!","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","You're going out with the stationery store guy?","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","Uh, uh.","the-big-salad",88
"GEORGE","You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.","the-big-salad",88
"TV","As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.","the-big-salad",88
"POLICE","9-1-1 What are you reporting","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.","the-big-salad",88
"POLICE","Okay, sir, and what's your name?","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!","the-big-salad",88
"GENDERSON","I told you not to take the turnpike.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","I thought we would blend in.","the-big-salad",88
"GENDERSON","If we took the palisades this never have happened.","the-big-salad",88
"KRAMER","we would have had all that bridge traffic.","the-big-salad",88
"GENDERSON","Ah, just drive.","the-big-salad",88
"JERRY","Jail doesn't really seem like that great of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying? Constantly calling him, hanging up when he answers the phone. Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long. After a while he would go, ""I wish that guy would kill me already, I can't take it anymore."" And how come when the police catch some really bad criminal or something they put him in the handcuffs, they hit him with the baton, they put the choke hold on him, then they're always careful they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the back of the patrol car. ""Watch your head, watch your head. Don't hit that metal edge there. . . . That REALLY hurts""","the-big-salad",88
"THE END"," THE END","the-big-salad",88
"ELAINE","She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Your friend, Noreen.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","If you don't believe me, ask her.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Check the pile.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Oh, who sent you a card?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Open it, it's from Hallmark.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Hello, my love.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Hello, darling.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Let me see.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Who's Kristin?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Did you ask her about me?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, go ahead.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","You sure you don't mind?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.","the-pledge-drive",89
"HIGH PITCHED VOICE","Hello?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.","the-pledge-drive",89
"HIGH PITCHED VOICE","Jerry?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Jerry Seinfeld.","the-pledge-drive",89

"DAN","You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Uh, I'll call you back later.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Uh oh.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","So was I right? She likes me, right?","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. PITT","Hello? (to Elaine) It's for you. Must you keep giving","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?","the-pledge-drive",89
"HIGH PITCHED VOICE","Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Is this Noreen?","the-pledge-drive",89
"HIGH PITCHED VOICE","What would ever possess you to make up a story","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--","the-pledge-drive",89
"DAN","I think I deserve an explanation.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Noreen, are you crying?","the-pledge-drive",89
"DAN","No, this is Dan!","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Oh, hi Dan.","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. PITT","Elaine? Work?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. PITT","Who was crying?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","No one. I'm sorry Mr. Putt, that won't happen again.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, I know you are.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","You got the card I sent?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I did.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","So where is it?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","What?","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","The card. Is this it in the trash?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","No?","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","This is my card, you threw it away.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Well--","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","I put a lot of thought into this card.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","Fine. I gotta get back to the office.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","You have no sentimentality.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRISTIN","Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Well, but, you see, I saved something!","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","New cards, huh?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","No, they're old cards from my grandmother.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Oh, a check.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I don't know, it's ten dollars.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","But you got a whole pile here. 1987?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh so what.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, get out of here.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.","the-pledge-drive",89
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive.","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","The rule is a minimum of two days.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","I'm making it up.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Absolutely.","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Let's have it.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","You want me to ask one of the Yankees.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Could you?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Alright. I'll run it by a few people.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","I should never have made that phone call.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Yes, she's very upset.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Who was flirting with you?","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","She wasn't flirting with you.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Really?","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Why does he do that?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Oh, you know.","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me,","the-pledge-drive",89
"WAITRESS","That's the extra toast. Get it?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened","the-pledge-drive",89
"ELAINE","What?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","So, what do you think?","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. MORGAN","A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. MORGAN","Uh, what the hell are you doing?","the-pledge-drive",89
"GEORGE","I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?","the-pledge-drive",89
"MR. MORGAN","You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.","the-pledge-drive",89
"JERRY","Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.","the-pledge-drive",89

"FRANK","They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha.","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","So Dad.","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","How could Jerry not say Hello?!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous(sic).","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[long pause--did he hear ""ridicurous""(sic)--should he say something--can't","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Ridiculous.","the-chinese-woman",90

"GEORGE","Did you say, ""The rines(sic) were crossed?""","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Did I?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","[pause] George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Divorced. That's really too bad..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","[coming out of bathroom] Oh my God! You know what I just realized?! If","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","I never thought of that.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? [mirthless] Haha!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Have you ever spent any time with these people..?","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","All right Superman's the exception.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[has been watching that with amazed disbelief]","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I","the-chinese-woman",90
"I"," I","the-chinese-woman",90

"JERRY","Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","You went back to the Jockeys?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Wrong again.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[pause] Oh, no.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","What? What?..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys..","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Eeaawww...","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Kramer, say it isn't so.","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Oh, it be so.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Don't you need a little.. help?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave,","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Well, you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!..","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while..","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Oh, he went insane?..","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[awkward, defensive yet hypothetical, avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","[has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement] I can't believe","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry, Noreen..","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","[pause] So you thought he was boring?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","[reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","I know--","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[apologetically] I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman!","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","It's Donna Chang.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[hits button] Come on up.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Well, I guess I just didn't realize it..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Okay..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","She was lost..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun..","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an'","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Hi.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","[to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Why? What happened?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Wow! That's amazing!","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Tonight?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin'","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","[calmly] We're not getting divorced.","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","You mother changed her mind.. [tries to catch a fly with his hand]","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","[glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's Very good! I'm very glad to hear","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","Yeah. We worked it out.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","He was my lawyer.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","You lawyer wears a cape..?","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","Yeah. So what?","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","Who wears a cape?","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","He looks ridiculous in that thing..","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","You have no eye for fashion!!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","All right! Come on!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","Georgie's right.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","So what made you change your mind?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","It was that Chinese woman.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[pause] Confucius, huh?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","Yeah.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[pause] You know, you're not Chinese...","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Hey! I heard the good news!","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Elaine was.. in a rush.","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","I knew it was Elaine!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","You must be Estelle.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","Yes. Who are you..?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","I'm Donna Chang!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","You're not Chinese!","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Hello?","the-chinese-woman",90

"KRAMER","Elaine!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Kramer?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","[pause] Yeahh!","the-chinese-woman",90

"KRAMER","Wellll, isn't it obvious?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?","the-chinese-woman",90

"ELAINE","Well? Can I talk to her?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[tired] Fine--would you just put her on?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while..","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","You feel?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","That's right!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","What are you insane?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here..","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Can't help ya, kid.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","You're not Chinese!?!?","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","[pause] No.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","I thought you were Chinese!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","I'm from Long Island.","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","Long Island?!?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"DONNA","I'm sorry..?","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","Well! Then, that changes everything!","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","What?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","She's not Chinese; I was duped!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chi","the-chinese-woman",90
"ESTELLE","I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","[chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because","the-chinese-woman",90
"FRANK","[from the living room, standing, shouts after them] You want a","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[pause, to DONNA] You know, you might wanna think about changin' your","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the","the-chinese-woman",90
"ELAINE","[pause] You know, everybody listens to the Chinese.","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","[has just bought a newspaper out of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","Hey.","the-chinese-woman",90
"GEORGE","I predicted it! [hits cab roof twice, it drives off]","the-chinese-woman",90
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late!","the-chinese-woman",90
"NOREEN","Who are you?!","the-chinese-woman",90
"MAN","[calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her get","the-chinese-woman",90
"THE END"," THE END","the-chinese-woman",90
"JERRY","The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, she got you to join a book club?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Nah, I don't like that one.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, what's your first book?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","It's kinda old, isn't it?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, sure...Truman Capote.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","He's a great writer.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, yeah.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Did you ever read anything by him?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","No. You?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Nah.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Hey, what's going on?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","New couch, baby!","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","New couch? Why?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Hello.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Hello.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","What are you doing with your old couch?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah, I'll take it.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Hey! Couch is comin.'","the-couch",91
"JERRY","It's here!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Yeah. So do I.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Ooh! Remember Poppie?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","What was that again?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","What made you resurrect that old idea?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, Kramer, I -","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Sign here.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Sure.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Did you offer those guys a drink?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Uh, no. Should I have?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","What kind of a person are you?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?""","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Ah ha...","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","You wanna know what I said?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I can't wait.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","""I do now.""","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Clever.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Is that something?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Yes.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Is that something?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yes.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Nice to meet you, Poppie.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, your mother must be very proud of you.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, what's good tonight?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Why not?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, you won't eat the pizza?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","No way.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Really.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Really!","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah. That's right.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, boy.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well...Poppie. I think differently.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","And what gives you the right to do that?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.","the-couch",91
"WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE","I heard that. Let's go, Henry.","the-couch",91
"HENRY","But we just got here...","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","And I am not coming back!","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","You're not welcome!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I'm sorry I missed it.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Oh...pretty good.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","So, what's it about?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Holly Go-Lightly.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Yeah, she's quite a character.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","No.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Big surprise.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","You're not very bright, are you?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Why don't you rent the movie?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","So...how was the dinner last night?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh...well...","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh...well...","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Alright, what did you do to Poppie?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Nothing.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","What's wrong with him?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","We should get him something.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah. You're right.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","You don't have any furniture?","the-couch",91
"CARL","No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Why, what...?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Well, we're not very close.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Oh, very good ducks.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","I'm in looove!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Whoa!","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","What?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","What is his stand...on abortion?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","How do you know?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.","the-couch",91
"CLERK","Uh, this is out. Someone has it.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.","the-couch",91
"CLERK","Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.","the-couch",91
"CLERK","Oh, sorry. We can't do that.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.","the-couch",91
"CLERK","I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.","the-couch",91
"VOICE ON INTERCOM","Yes?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?","the-couch",91
"INTERCOM","Yes.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Hey, what's happenin.'","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Okay. Hi, Poppie.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Hello.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","No.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)","the-couch",91
"JERRY","...the...the...","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","So long. I'll see you tonight.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","What is what?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","This puddle on my sofa!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","What puddle?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","I don't know.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Are you sure?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","I'm sure it'll come out.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Ah, you're making too much of it.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Right!","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.","the-couch",91
"JOE","Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","She was a delicate flower.","the-couch",91
"JOE","Why didn't you just read the book?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)","the-couch",91
"JOE","Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)","the-couch",91
"CARL","Hi.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Hi. (They kiss.)","the-couch",91
"CARL","I missed you.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh, I missed you!","the-couch",91
"CARL","I don't remember the last time I felt this way.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Me, either!","the-couch",91
"CARL","I think about you all the time.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","You do?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Do you think about me?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.","the-couch",91
"CARL","What friend?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)","the-couch",91
"CARL","You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","So, anything to uh, nosh?","the-couch",91
"JOE","What did you want?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Popcorn?","the-couch",91
"REMY","Popcorn? Where do you think you are?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.","the-couch",91
"REMY","Well, we don't.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.","the-couch",91
"JOE","Here's some nuts.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.","the-couch",91
"REMY","Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.)","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'","the-couch",91
"JOE","The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Not too much!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Wait a second...what is that?","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","It's cucumbers.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","Well, why not? I like cucumbers.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","But that's the idea, you make your own pie.","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Because it's a pizza!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!","the-couch",91
"KRAMER","No, it isn't!","the-couch",91
"POPPIE","Yes, it is!","the-couch",91
"JOE","Hey, honey.","the-couch",91
"REMY","Hi, Mom.","the-couch",91
"JOE","Yeah.","the-couch",91
"JOE","Aw, that's too bad.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Joe...could you...","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.","the-couch",91
"JOE","This is George Costanza.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","This is very hard to follow with all the talking.","the-couch",91
"JOE","I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)","the-couch",91
"REMY","He's in some book club.","the-couch",91
"REMY","Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.)","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.","the-couch",91
"REMY","What?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","C'mon, you took my seat.","the-couch",91
"REMY","It's not your seat.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I was sitting there, c'mon.","the-couch",91
"REMY","You didn't save it.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","I had the arm! Joe...","the-couch",91
"JOE","What's the difference?","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...","the-couch",91
"REMY","It's my couch.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)","the-couch",91
"REMY","Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.)","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Joe...","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Oh my god.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","You see?!","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","So, you're gonna get a new couch?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Well, I guess I have no choice.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Do you want your old couch back?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?","the-couch",91
"INTERCOM","It's the movers.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Who's that?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","No, no, he's not my boyfriend.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Why?","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Take a guess.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Hi.","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Today?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","Could you?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Sure.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","What are you doing with this couch?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","George is taking it.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Did you tell him it was peed on?","the-couch",91
"JERRY","He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.","the-couch",91
"CARL","I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah, me too.","the-couch",91
"CARL","It's just too bad.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Yeah. It is.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","Can I offer you anything to drink?","the-couch",91
"CARL","Yeah, sure.","the-couch",91
"ELAINE","All I've got is grape juice.","the-couch",91
"CARL","Throw it!","the-couch",91
"CARL","The couch!","the-couch",91
"MARIE","She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.","the-couch",91
"GEORGE","Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.","the-couch",91
"MARIE","George...Fred's gay.","the-couch",91
"THE END"," THE END","the-couch",91
"JERRY","I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!""","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" thing.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","I think she finds my stupidity charming.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","As we all do.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll love me.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","You're good with the mothers.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Maybe you should date the mothers.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh, you got something goin'.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(enters apartment) Hey.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Hey! (heads toward bathroom)","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Hey, you got a hammer?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What do you need a hammer for?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Nah, I don't think so.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(inside bathroom) Nah.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Oh, COME ON!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","A gymnast!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(shuts door) ""Bailing""?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Jerry, you should pay that price.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Ch- oo-... what?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(stares at George, incredulous) ""Back on""? What was it doing off?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office"".","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(laughing) What for?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Unbuttoned, or all the way off?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","ALL the way, baby!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Of course.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Always.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","What meeting?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Oh! (tries to take paper)","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Yes?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Elaine?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Come in, come in!","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Ah, right there, yeah.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(rips open package) Yeah, that's...","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Kramer, it's...","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(holds up framed picture): There she blows! (throws paper around)","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Oh, these are nice corners, huh?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I don't see it.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I still don't see it.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","A spaceship, where?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Kramer, what's wrong?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Mama!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.","the-gymnast",92
"LINDSAY","Mother...","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","Oh? Are you and your family close?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.","the-gymnast",92
"LINDSAY","Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","Can I offer you anything to eat?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","Oh no, George, you don't have to...","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","No, I know I don't have to, I want to.","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","George, you are such a gentleman.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","(wide-eyed) Oh...","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(spits out mouthful of food): Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!","the-gymnast",92

"MR. PITT","Where is it?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(pointing) Right here.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I'm looking there!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","No, no, unfocus.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I am unfocused!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(still staring at picture) Meeting?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Why don't you go for me?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","How can I go?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Oh, DAMN this thing!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!""","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","And you could not refuse.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","No, you'd have to be crazy.","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","He was a very bad dictator.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, ""What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.""","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Was it in the trash?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Then it was trash.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","But it was in the cylinder!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Above the rim.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Was it eaten?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","One little bite.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, that's garbage.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Hey!","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What's with you?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","I got a stone.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What stone?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","A kidney stone.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What is that, anyway?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh, that's gotta hurt.","the-gymnast",92
"ARONSON","Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)","the-gymnast",92
"BECK","And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?","the-gymnast",92
"BECK","Moland Spring.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(making a face) ""Moland""?","the-gymnast",92
"ARONSON","Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything called ""Moland"".","the-gymnast",92
"ARONSON","But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?","the-gymnast",92
"ARONSON","(to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Good for you.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yes, good for me!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Jerry, what is your problem?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","No.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Tantric yoga?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","No.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","All right.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Did you pass your stone yet?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","Yes. We are here.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","I can balance myself in any position.","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh boy...","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Well, what did you think she was gonna do?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","No, what?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","You mean like the uneven parallel bars?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","See, again, I really don't feel that...","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","The balance beam?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Could we stop?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","All right. Let's just drop it.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","I dunno, at least three weeks.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","(sarcastic) Oh, great.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Between Poland and Morgan?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Yeah. Started a big name controversy.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Kramer! The stone!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What happened, did you pass the stone?","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..."" (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)","the-gymnast",92
"MAN IN CAR","Hey! What the hell was that?!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-","the-gymnast",92
"MAN IN CAR","Clean that up!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.","the-gymnast",92
"MRS. ENRIGHT","(sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled)","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Strike two!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","You think I'm going down?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","You're behind in the count.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","I know.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","All right, where you going?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Yeah, well you're going.","the-gymnast",92
"KRAMER","Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I like the name ""Moland"". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Well, I'm so sorry! I-","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","""Greatest Show on Earth""!","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","Ah, Misha!","the-gymnast",92
"MISHA","Katya!","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","Misha, this is Jerry.","the-gymnast",92
"MISHA","Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya)","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","(laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry)","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","In about twenty minutes.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an ""Adolph Hitler""-style moustache) Do I have time to change?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Um, no.","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Uh, Mr. Pitt...","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","Yes?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?","the-gymnast",92
"ELAINE","No?","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Well, here we are.","the-gymnast",92
"LINDSAY","Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Maybe I could just use the bathroom.","the-gymnast",92
"LINDSAY","Sure.","the-gymnast",92
"ANNOUNCER","(voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.","the-gymnast",92
"MISHA","It is time.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Well, break a leg.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Eh, show biz...","the-gymnast",92
"ANNOUNCER","Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Boy, those capes are really coming back.","the-gymnast",92
"PARTY GUEST","(exits bathroom, finds George waiting) Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) It's mesmerizing.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","What is that sound?","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","(covering ears) It is horrible!","the-gymnast",92
"GEORGE","Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!","the-gymnast",92
"MR. PITT","I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Oh, why not?","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","Really?","the-gymnast",92
"KATYA","In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the ""Comedian"". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. (walks off)","the-gymnast",92
"THE END"," THE END","the-gymnast",92
"JERRY","I like the names they have for cars. Like, no baron has ever owned a LeBaron. Or the Ford LTD. ""LTD."" Limited. It's a ""limited"" edition...what did they make, fifty million of those? ""Yes, it's 'limited' to the number we can sell."" Or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name, you know how they'll do that? The ""Integra."" Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The ""Supra."" Or the ""Impreza."" Yeah? Well, I hope it's not a ""lemona""...or you'll be hearing from my ""lawya.""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"CAR SALESMAN","George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"SALESMAN","I got a LeBaron convertible right here.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","N.I. Not interested.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"SALESMAN","It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Jon Voight?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Was that Tim Whatley?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Why?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Uh - new car!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Ohhh!  Mark's Michelle is a dog.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey! Did you get the Volvo?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","A LeBaron?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","What Consumer? I'm the consumer.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Jon Voight? The actor?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","No, no...","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Alright, maybe I do. So what.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I like coffee.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","I like (imitates Kramer) ""cookies.""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Alright, take 'em.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Yeah-yah.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MOM","So many sneakers!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","They'll be ready a week from Thursday.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MOM","What's the matter?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MOM","Oh, lie down, and put your head back.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Elaine?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Yes, Mr. Pitt?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","No, I'm still working on it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","What in blazes are you listening to?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" (The song ends.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DJ ON RADIO","That was Artie Shaw, ""Honeysuckle Jump.""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Elaine! How did you know that?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DJ ON RADIO","Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words ""Woody Woodpecker."") There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DJ ON RADIO","Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Will you shut up? I can't hear!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","I'm sorry!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. PITT","Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","You said take 'em.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Not all of 'em!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I can't wear these!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, why not?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","They're uncomfortable.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Where did you get those?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","But I don't wanna be a cowboy!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Yeah, I got one too.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Yeah?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Oh yeah? Huh.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No, nothing.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","No, what is it?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","You didn't get one?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Not necessarily.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","That's the genius of it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Boss!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELECTRICIAN","Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","But what if we can't pay for it?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELECTRICIAN","Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"POP","48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","So?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","C'mon, put the top up, it's November!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","I feel alive, Jerry.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Ah! See? I told ya.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","So?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","So, what are you saying?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Get out of the car!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Get out!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TOUGH GUY","Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better run!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Did they take anything?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","You really seemed to enjoy it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yeah, that's possible.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","He'll dispose of it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yeah...","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","So...?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Alright, but let me ask you this question.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring.""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I think he emphasized ""would.""","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey, so where's my sneakers?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","That's what I wanna know.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","What do you mean?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","So all my sneakers are gone?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Apparently.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Alright, that's enough of this.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Where ya goin'?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. MORGAN","So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"MR. MORGAN","Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"CONTEST WINNER","I guessed Stan Herman's ""Boomtown Blues."" What'd you guess?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville."" (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"CONTEST WINNER","After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"VOIGHT","Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No Jon Voight Day, huh?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","You should have somebody take a look at that.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","You going to the party?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No, I don't know if I'm invited.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yeah, you're right.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Maybe I'll just meet you there.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","You don't want to go with me?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, he was a little standoffish.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","What, you didn't ask him about the car?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","His tooth marks. He bit me.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Jon Voight bit you?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Well, what is he, a vampire?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","He left perfect imprints.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Oh, please.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","No, it's stupid.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","That's right. He's a troublemaker.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","What is that, the Empire State Building?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","What? I can't hear you.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Elaine, would you marry me?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","I told you, I can't hear a word.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Alright. Forget it.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Hey, Tim.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","No, it's no problem, what is it?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GUY","Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Uh, Tim, the pencil...","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Jerry.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Hey, Tim.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? (Elaine comes over.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Elaine! Hi!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Tim.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Well. I'm really glad you came.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Really glad you came.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","Uh huh.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ELAINE","What? What?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DENTIST","It's possible.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Roll up your sleeve.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DENTIST","Somebody bit you?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Not just someone. Jon Voight.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DENTIST","Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","That's John Voight's pencil?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GEORGE","Jon Voight, the actor?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DENTIST","Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"DENTIST","Alright. Sit down.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"TIM","Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"ANNOUNCER ON TV","Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Those kids look pretty disappointed.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GUY ON PHONE","Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Yes it is.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"GUY ON PHONE","You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Where are they?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","Parsippany, New Jersey.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Let's go!","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"JERRY","My car's in the shop.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?","the-mom-and-pop-store",93
"KRAMER","Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.","the-mom-and-pop-store",93

"ELAINE","What soup place?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Stunned by soup?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Huh. All right. Come on.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Why? What happens if you don't order right?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","He yells and you don't get your soup.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","What?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","What?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","The main thing is to keep the line moving.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Oh, boy, I'm really scared!","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Elaine.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Ar-moire.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","How much is this?","the-soup",94

"JERRY","He gave you the nice face discount.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","What about the soup?","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","(in French accent) Pardon.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","This line is huge.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","It's like this all the time.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Isn't that that Bania guy?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Oh, no. It is. Just be still.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.","the-soup",94
"BANIA","Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Hard to believe.","the-soup",94
"BANIA","This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.","the-soup",94
"BANIA","Why not?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.","the-soup",94
"BANIA","Okay. Okay.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Medium turkey chili.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Medium crab bisque.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","I didn't get any bread.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Just forget it. Let it go.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.","the-soup",94
"SOUP NAZI","Bread -- $2 extra.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.","the-soup",94
"SOUP NAZI","You want bread?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Yes, please.","the-soup",94
"SOUP NAZI","$3!","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","What?","the-soup",94
"SOUP NAZI","No soup for you! (snaps fingers)","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.","the-soup",94
"SUPER","It's Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.","the-soup",94
"SUPER","Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.","the-soup",94
"FURNITURE GUY","I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","I gave you a taste. What do you want?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Why can't we share?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Do you hear yourself?","the-soup",94
"JERRY","I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.","the-soup",94
"SHEILA","Hi. Hi shmoopy.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Hi shmoopy.","the-soup",94
"SHEILA","No, you're a shmoopy!","the-soup",94
"JERRY","You're a shmoopy!","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","I'm going.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Why?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","I just don't feel like it anymore.","the-soup",94
"JERRY","Just like that?","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","Just like that.","the-soup",94
"SHEILA","Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?","the-soup",94

"KRAMER","Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Do you need anything?","the-soup",94
"KRAMER","Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Mulligatawny?","the-soup",94
"KRAMER","Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?","the-soup",94
"KRAMER","He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","All right. I'll be back.","the-soup",94

"ELAINE","You know, we should say something.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","You know, we absolutely should.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-soup",94
"GEORGE","I still haven't figured him out.","the-soup",94
"ELAINE","No. Me neither.","the-soup",94

"JERRY","""The Switch.""","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","Can't be done.","the-switch",96
"JERRY","I wonder.","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has","the-switch",96
"JERRY","They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and","the-switch",96

"GEORGE","All right, dammit, I'm in.","the-switch",96
"JERRY","I couldn't do it without you.","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","All right. Let's get to work.","the-switch",96

"JERRY","All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","That's right.","the-switch",96
"JERRY","And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect.","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","Keep going.","the-switch",96
"JERRY","At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","Continue.","the-switch",96
"JERRY","The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to","the-switch",96
"JERRY","Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it:","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She","the-switch",96
"JERRY","It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.","the-switch",96
"GEORGE","{George, finger in the peanut butter jar}: This is what I do.","the-switch",96

"KRAMER","The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So why don't you leave it at Newman's?","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","I wanted to, he won't let me.","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So that's here?","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.","the-label-maker",97

"JERRY","One Tim Whatley!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this gift.  He's","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Yeah, perhaps.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Well how did he react when you gave it to him?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Um, he said, ""Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?""","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","He repeated the name of the gift?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Yeah, so?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","What do you mean?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Why'd you get him a gift anyway?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm a","the-label-maker",97

"GEORGE","I love it!  This is fantastic!  Look at this couch, is this velvet?!","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Are you a velvet fan?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","A fan?  I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Aren't they great? (sees a man enter from the bedroom)  Oh, Scott, hi.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Heh heh.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Here, check out this view.  If you lean out this window, you can see","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","So Scott's your roommate, huh?","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Yes.  Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","No, you didn't mention it.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","He's a great guy, you'll really like him.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I'm sure I will.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Male roommate, huh?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Yes.  A male roommate.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Is this a problem?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","It's a huge problem, Jerry.  The hardest part about having sex with a","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Well, maybe he's --","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","No.  Believe me, he's not.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So he's an eligible receiver.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What's stopping them?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What does he look like?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","He looks like you and he's working from the inside?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do you think is","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Not you.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","We'll take a check please.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's so","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I've said that before?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Hey.","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So what?","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Are you through?","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's","the-label-maker",97

"KRAMER","The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?  There's no","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Well, didn't he regift the label maker?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Possibly.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You may have a point.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I have a point, I have a point.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Alright, I'll call him.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Yeah.  What's that?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Thanks.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What are you gonna do about the roommate?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Well, the pickle breath is a good start.","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Hello Jerry, may I come in?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What do you want?","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Nothing, just being","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Jerry?  I'm a little insulted.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me.  I'll be the","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You're going to the Super Bowl?","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What's his name?","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Tim Whatley.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","That's my ticket!","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","Is it?!  Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Newman!","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","What a movie.  Good choice.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Thank Scott.  He recommended it.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Yes he is.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Yes he is.  Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","George?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","George, you're being ridiculous.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","What's the massage situation?","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","What do you mean?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, finger","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","George, would you just stop?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","George, what is wrong with you?","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  It's","the-label-maker",97

"GEORGE","I'm good.","the-label-maker",97
"SCOTT","Are you gonna need the bathroom?  'Cause I'm gonna jump in","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","No, just throw my bras out of the way.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Well, this is my building.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Yes it is.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","This was fun, you know?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","So, I'll call.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Upstairs?  You wanna go upstairs?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I would love to go upstairs.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Elaine, you are something else.  No one can ever put a label on you, huh?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","We'll see.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Newman.  He's going with Newman.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Newman's his mailman.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Well, he's merry.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","He is merry, I'll give him that.  (notices a cactus on the table)","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","What about the label maker?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Ah, well.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Wait a minute, that's my ticket!  You didn't even want to go.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his apartment, you","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So, how did you get up there?  Did you say you had to use the bathroom?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","No.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Then how'd you get up there?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?""","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","And there's you ticket.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","What?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Why?","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Obviously.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","You're crazy.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Well, what happened when you got upstairs?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted,","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Hey.  What are you doing?","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","I'm watching your door.","the-label-maker",97

"NEWMAN","Damn!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","The bedroom!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","I see you, Newman!  I see you!","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I've got a confession to make.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Oh?  What's that?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I've got Super Bowl fever.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Oh yeah, me too.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","So where are we staying?","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Oh, the Ambassador.","the-label-maker",97

"ELAINE","What do they have there, a couple of beds?","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Why?  You bringing someone else?","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's two of us.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","Oh, a cactus.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the","the-label-maker",97
"SCOTT","Well, look who's here.","the-label-maker",97
"BONNIE","I asked Scott to move out.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Oh.  Oh!","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","So she kicked him out of the apartment.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","That's right.  It's just me and her.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","That's not a good role for you.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","No, it's not.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","Oh my god.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.","the-label-maker",97
"JERRY","He was shouldering.","the-label-maker",97
"GEORGE","I couldn't leave well enough alone?!","the-label-maker",97

"NEWMAN","Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Oh, stop stalling.  Come on.","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","I can't think, there's all this noise.","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  I've driven","the-label-maker",97
"NEWMAN","I'm not beaten yet.  I still have armies in the Ukraine.","the-label-maker",97
"KRAMER","Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  It's a sitting","the-label-maker",97
"UKRAINIAN","I come from Ukraine.  You not say Ukraine weak.","the-label-maker",97

"TIM","But you gave it to me.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, Whatley.","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Uh, ok.","the-label-maker",97

"TIM","Uh, no.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","I knew it!  You're a regifter!","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Oh, yeah, some gift.  That thing didn't work at all.","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","What?","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right","the-label-maker",97
"ELAINE","Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to","the-label-maker",97
"TIM","Oh, Elaine!","the-label-maker",97

"GEORGE","Duncan Meyers?","the-race",98
"ELAINE","Who's he?","the-race",98
"JERRY","Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.","the-race",98
"ELAINE","Uh uh","the-race",98
"JERRY","I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .","the-race",98
"ELAINE","What's that?","the-race",98
"JERRY","Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.","the-race",98
"ELAINE","Oh, of course.","the-race",98
"JERRY","He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.","the-race",98
"ELAINE","No.","the-race",98
"GEORGE","I looked up. I couldn't believe it.","the-race",98
"JERRY","By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.","the-race",98
"ELAINE","Really?","the-race",98
"JERRY","And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my","the-race",98
"ELAINE","Well what happened when you raced him again?","the-race",98
"JERRY","I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.","the-race",98
"ELAINE","So now Duncan is back?","the-race",98
"JERRY","He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man","the-race",98

"JERRY","I did not cheat.","the-race",98
"LOIS","He said that you got a head start.","the-race",98
"JERRY","Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.","the-race",98
"LOIS","Really?","the-race",98

"JERRY","I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?","the-race",98

The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...","the-race",98

Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.","the-race",98

Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't havelike a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then.

"GARY","All right, I got lunch, all right.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","You still owe me a secret.","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Yeah?","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll see you.","the-scofflaw",99

"KRAMER","(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know,","the-scofflaw",99
"KRAMER","Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave)","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I","the-scofflaw",99
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","I never heard her say hi.","the-scofflaw",99
"KRAMER","Well, it's uh, common courtesy.","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","It's like a game of tag.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Where you going?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Nowhere.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","So what if I do? (heads for the door)","the-scofflaw",99
"KRAMER","(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there,","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Hey. How'd it go with Gary?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","(suspicious) Really?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(shifty) Yeah.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","You look like something's on your mind.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","So, that's your poker face.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","My regular face.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","What are you saying?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","I got nothing.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","What you got, a pair of bullets?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","What you talking about?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Two pair? Three of a kind?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Will you stop it?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","I don't have a flush.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","You're saying you didn't say hi.","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","That's what I'm saying.","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","So that's what you came down here to tell me?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Correct.","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","You never said hi?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Correct.","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","You still like me, don't you?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Correct. (catches herself) What's that?","the-scofflaw",99
"MAN","Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","So what was wrong with him?","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Nothing!","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","So he's been lying to me for two months?!","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","That's right.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Well...","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","I don't even think you could do it.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Oh, I could do it.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Yeah, I guess you could.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(snorts) C'mon.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","You did that?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take","the-scofflaw",99

"GEORGE","I thought it was a date.","the-scofflaw",99
"DEBBY","No. It's not a date.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","What about the regards?","the-scofflaw",99

"GEORGE","The one who always sits by herself?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Yeah!","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","How did he do that?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(opening door to leave) He picked her up?","the-scofflaw",99

"LIPPMAN","Really?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.","the-scofflaw",99
"LIPPMAN","(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","They're from Malaysia.","the-scofflaw",99
"LIPPMAN","(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","(admiring gasp) Fabulous.","the-scofflaw",99
"JUDGE","Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across","the-scofflaw",99
"JUDGE","...convenient to your home.","the-scofflaw",99
"NEWMAN","(sobbing) I can't afford that!","the-scofflaw",99
"JUDGE","Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is","the-scofflaw",99
"JUDGE","...and sold at auction.","the-scofflaw",99
"KRAMER","Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","(unimpressed) I, really can't say.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","No, say. I want you to say.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid.","the-scofflaw",99
"SALESMAN","You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.","the-scofflaw",99
"SALESMAN","As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!","the-scofflaw",99
"SALESMAN","(getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys","the-scofflaw",99
"SALESMAN","(angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(leaps to feet) Jerry!","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","I'm sorry.","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Please. (sits again)","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get a rug! Good for","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","Well, I'm, I'm just looking.","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.","the-scofflaw",99
"SALESMAN","I'll be right with you.","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","What?","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","What?","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the","the-scofflaw",99
"GARY","(to George) You didn't?!","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","(admiring himself in mirror) I did.","the-scofflaw",99

"GARY","(indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Gimme that thing!","the-scofflaw",99
"GEORGE","How's your life? All right?","the-scofflaw",99
"WOMAN","Yeah, not bad at all.","the-scofflaw",99

"REPORTER","So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?","the-scofflaw",99
"LIPPMAN","Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that.","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","(notices glasses) Where did you get those?","the-scofflaw",99
"LIPPMAN","... as such, it...","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?","the-scofflaw",99
"LIPPMAN","(confused) Where... what?","the-scofflaw",99
"JAKE","(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's","the-scofflaw",99
"ELAINE","(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.","the-scofflaw",99
"THE END"," THE END","the-scofflaw",99
"JERRY","Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out. (horrified) ""There was a hair, in the egg salad!""","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I would think.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yeah? Would you do it?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Yes, I think I would.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I have to go over to my grandmother's.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","What for?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","So, what, no lunch?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","No, we have time.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Oh. How's she doing?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Like toothpaste?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Ya-hah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","There's a squeeze ketchup.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I really don't see the difference.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","It's subtle.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","What?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Really?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(from a distance) Hey.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","No, I told you I admire your hearing.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","You're uh, physical therapist, right?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Yes.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(warning) George.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Have you tried heat and ice on it?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(happy) Oh! Okay.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Let me give you my card.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Oh, thank you.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Bye Jerry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Bye.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","What?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Because, it is what she does.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","George, you got a little something, right here.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Why?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(regarding the menu) What're you getting?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Yeah. Hah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(to Kramer) ...Kramer.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hello, boys and girls.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Speak of the devil.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","What for?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Why?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey,","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hello, uncle Leo!","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","What're you doing here?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Yeah, me too.","the-kiss-hello",100
"NANA","Hello Jerry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hi Nana.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.","the-kiss-hello",100
"NANA","Ha, well, here's the bottle.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Give it to me.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Will you stop it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Jerry, will you give me the bottle?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!","the-kiss-hello",100
"NANA","You should let Buddy open it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.","the-kiss-hello",100
"NANA","Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","What fifty dollars?","the-kiss-hello",100
"NANA","Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I'm just not getting any hot water.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JULIO","Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Thanks, Julio.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JULIO","Awright.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Huh?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","What's going on here?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Oh, I, I need a pen.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","What for?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","You got that straight.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I told you, forget it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","You're robbing me.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Wha... W.. Are you going home?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Why?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Yeah, she'll be here any second.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to","the-kiss-hello",100
"MORTY","Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to","the-kiss-hello",100
"HELEN","Oh, Morty, please.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MORTY","Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And","the-kiss-hello",100
"HELEN","Morty, will you stop it!","the-kiss-hello",100
"MORTY","(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Wendy.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Come on up.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in,","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(indicating) That's her. That's her.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINEWENDY","HiHey.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(muffled) Hi Wendy.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Oh, hi Jerry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(muffled) Would you like something to drink?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Sure.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(muffled) There you go.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","(taking the bottle) Ah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","So, how's everything going?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hey! Jerry!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","C'mon, that's not fair!","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","I told you I was gonna get it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.","the-kiss-hello",100

"WENDY","(holds out her hand) Hi.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(shaking hands) Yeah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(hopeful) Oh, you were?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Well, I...","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Oh, well.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Oh, Kramer.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","You wanna go out with him?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Well, why not?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...","the-kiss-hello",100

"JERRY","(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Why?","the-kiss-hello",100

"JERRY","Ah, well. Thank you very much!","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","For what?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Family?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle","the-kiss-hello",100
"RECEPTIONIST","Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","What d'you mean?","the-kiss-hello",100
"RECEPTIONIST","She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","When did you leave the message?","the-kiss-hello",100
"RECEPTIONIST","Few hours ago.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice","the-kiss-hello",100
"RECEPTIONIST","Look, Mister Costanza...","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Will that be cash, or cheque?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","I am really glad I took the day off.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Ugh, the hell with 'em.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","What're you stopping here for?","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","I'm dropping you off.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Yeah, but it's only three blocks.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Right. It's only three blocks.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","You should have her work on it for you.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Yeah, alright, I gotta go.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MAR","Hi Jerry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hi Mary.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LOU","Hi Jerry.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hi Louise...","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss","the-kiss-hello",100

"HELEN","Jerry?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?","the-kiss-hello",100
"HELEN","Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MORTY","No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll","the-kiss-hello",100
"HELEN","Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Okay, I will.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MORTY","D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","What's up?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing","the-kiss-hello",100

"JERRY","Hey, Kramer, look at this.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Look at my picture!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","I've been defaced!","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JACK","Hey. Hi Cosmo.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hi Jack.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today,","the-kiss-hello",100
"JULIO","Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(defensive) No no, that's not true!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JULIO","(accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld,","the-kiss-hello",100
"NURSE","Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here,","the-kiss-hello",100
"NURSE","Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Buddy?","the-kiss-hello",100
"NURSE","Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","A delicate genius?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Elaine?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(surprised) George!","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","(leaving) Hah. Good luck.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","What's going on?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Oh sure. You have insurance, right?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","How did you hear that?","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","I hear everything.","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere,","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.","the-kiss-hello",100
"GEORGE","Yeah. Let's go.","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about","the-kiss-hello",100
"WENDY","Why, what's wrong with my hair?","the-kiss-hello",100
"ELAINE","Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to","the-kiss-hello",100
"RECEPTIONIST","She's right.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","So you were with him that day at the track?","the-kiss-hello",100
"BUDDY","Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Leo?","the-kiss-hello",100
"BUDDY","Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Is that so?","the-kiss-hello",100
"BUDDY","And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Well, that's very interesting.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.","the-kiss-hello",100
"LEO","(defensive) One second...","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(with a triumphant point) You're busted!","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hey, Steve. How you doing?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hey, Jeff. What's happening?","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!","the-kiss-hello",100
"MARY","(contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and","the-kiss-hello",100
"JEFF","Hi Mary.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MARY","Hi Jeff. How are you?","the-kiss-hello",100
"MARY","Hi Pete. How you doing?","the-kiss-hello",100
"PETE","Hey, let's go get some coffee.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JEFF","Great idea.","the-kiss-hello",100
"MARY","Oh, that'd be great.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hi.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Hey. Could I use your shower?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","What, again? You took one this morning.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment)","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's","the-kiss-hello",100
"GUY","I'll go get some more beer.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-kiss-hello",100
"STEFANIE","Hi Cosmo.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Hi.","the-kiss-hello",100
"STEFANIE","(kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Ooh, I like that.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(impressed) Who's that?","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Stefanie. 2-G.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.","the-kiss-hello",100
"KRAMER","Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.","the-kiss-hello",100
"THE END"," THE END","the-kiss-hello",100
"JERRY","Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I know. I need a lesson.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You stink. You know you stink. What is this?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh. My ballet tickets.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Oh. Your ballet tickets.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","You know, I'm going as a beard.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","A beard?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yes.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Why are you doing this?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Swan Lake, at the Met.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","I think he looks fantastic.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh, come on.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","You look ridiculous in that thing.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Well what about me?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No I think he's got you beat buddy.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","So she's gorgeous.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Well have you got a picture?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Well, I have to see her.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Really?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah. I think he will.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","It sounds like an excellent idea.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Here you go brother. Some food for you.","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Now are you going to be here in an hour?","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","Where am I going?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?","the-beard",101
"LOU","Almond?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Pouty? I like that.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You can't go wrong with pouty.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I'm excited about the pouty.","the-beard",101
"LOU","All right I think that about does it.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","All right George, come on, take a look.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?","the-beard",101
"LOU","Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey, man. Enjoy the food?","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","I don't think so.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Woah, woah, that's mine.","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","You gave it to me.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","You should have said something.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","I've really got to thank you for this.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yes indeed.","the-beard",101
"BOSS","I'm surprised.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Really. Why?","the-beard",101
"BOSS","No reason.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh, hi honey.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh it was such a great night.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","And did they suspect anything?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh it was such a great night. Oh.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You said that already.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh I did?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","He's incredible.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah, but?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah, I know.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","So?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","What?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well it did occur to me.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Why? Is it irrevocable?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","We've got a good team.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Why can't he play for us?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","We just got along *so* great.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I realize that.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Are you that desperate?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yes I am.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What are you looking for?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Tupperware.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What about a plastic bag?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","You must be kidding.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What is the difference?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, you talked to her.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Yeah well we go way back.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Why didn't anything happen between you two?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Who's to say it didn't?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Yes I did.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What did you say to her?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","What do you think I said?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I told her the truth.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","As you see it?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Yes, as I see it.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","What hat?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You know, you're little hair hat there.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","No.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Don't you think she could tell?","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","You only think that because you know me.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Have you noticed people staring at your head?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Look, I guarantee she won't know.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Oh, I'll split a cab with you.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","Hey that's my coffee!","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hi Sarge.","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Sure. I will.","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.","the-beard",101
"OVER THE SPEAKER","All of you, turn to the left.","the-beard",101
"OVER THE SPEAKER","The left.","the-beard",101
"OVER THE SPEAKER","Now turn to the right.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.","the-beard",101
"DENISE","George?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.","the-beard",101
"DENISE","Likewise. Have you been waiting long?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.","the-beard",101
"DENISE","Good, good.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What's that?","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Really.","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","Have you ever seen the show?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","No.","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","I admit it. I don't watch it.","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","The poly?","the-beard",101
"TIERNEY","Yeah. I think you've seen it.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Melrose Place?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yes. Melrose Place.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I just didn't know you watched that.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Well I do.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...","the-beard",101
"JERRY","And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Why? Why were you so embarrassed?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","So what are you going to do?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh god this tastes terrible.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Did you shake it up?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","No.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You gotta shake it up.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","So tonight are you going to make the move?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah, I think I might.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","That's an interesting question.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","How so?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","What do you mean bald?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","She's bald?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","She's bald.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh come on.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well maybe she got a haircut or something.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine.""","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Women go bald?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hey.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","You fixed me up with a bald woman.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Bald?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Yeah, that's right.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","So?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","No I'm not. I *was* bald.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Elaine.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","No, no, no Elaine.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Nooooo.","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well I figured that's what couples do.","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","You almost convinced me we were a couple.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well it was easy. Really.","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Upstairs?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah. Upstairs?","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Elaine...","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","Changing teams?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Have you ever thought about it?","the-beard",101
"ROBERT","But I'm a starting shortstop.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Good to have you back.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","She's as good as anybody else.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Going to need a little more coffee here.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","So George, how do I beat this lie detector?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you.""","the-beard",101
"JERRY","All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Hey, I did it.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","What?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I turned him. He defected.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot.","the-beard",101
"LOU","What's your name?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Jerry Seinfeld.","the-beard",101
"LOU","What is your address?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","129 West 81st street.","the-beard",101

"JERRY","I don't know.","the-beard",101
"LOU","Did Jane sleep with Michael again?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked","the-beard",101
"JERRY","He went back? What do you mean he went back?","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","He went back.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what,","the-beard",101
"JERRY","You can't. That's why they lose very few players.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Well there's always a place for you, on our team.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Okay.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","What is the matter?","the-beard",101
"GEORGE","I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You","the-beard",101
"ELAINE","I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.","the-beard",101
"JERRY","Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.","the-beard",101
"KRAMER","Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better","the-beard",101
"MAN","I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the","the-beard",101
"HOMELESS MAN","That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high","the-beard",101

"JERRY","You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you wouldthink, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen. (as belligerent doorman) ""Let's see how they do without us!"" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag? (as window washer) ""We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!""","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Oh. House-sitting, mmm.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Can I just go up?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","How 'bout those Knicks?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Oh, I see. On the sports page...","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-doorman",102

"KRAMER","So, you think your parents'll get back together?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Hey, George, stick 'em up.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","What?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Why?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Awright, hands up, porky!","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Alright, that's enough.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you","the-doorman",102

"ELAINE","What guy?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(unhappy) I...","the-doorman",102

"GEORGE","What'd you do today, dad?","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record,","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","I don't have a hi-fi.","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Didn't I give you my old record player?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","I'm Cosmo.","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.","the-doorman",102

"ELAINE","Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","No, don't...","the-doorman",102

"MR. PITT","(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Alright, he just left. We can go.","the-doorman",102
"MR. PITT","(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh,","the-doorman",102
"MR. PITT","I need to know what's in the mail.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying","the-doorman",102
"MR. PITT","(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...","the-doorman",102
"MR. PITT","(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Hey, buddy.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","You got a problem with that?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","My father opened his shirt...","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Yeah, and?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","(matter of fact) He had breasts.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","What d'you mean, breasts?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(waves his hands) Big breasts!","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","So what? A lot of older men have that.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","No, not these. These were real hooters.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","But, your father's not bald.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","You mean like a bra?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.","the-doorman",102
"BUXOM WOMAN","(indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(thinking she means the breasts) What!!","the-doorman",102
"BUXOM WOMAN","Our shirts. They're the same.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Oh, Huh, imagine that.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","What? Nothing.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Hey, did you make the movie?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","No.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Yes, we do.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","What is wrong with George?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","He's... trying to get something off his chest.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Help you?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","You wanna be friends?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","I'd like to be.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Then watch the door for a minute, would you?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","What?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Oh.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?","the-doorman",102
"MR. GREEN","(indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(after the guy) You think you're better than me?","the-doorman",102
"DELIVERY GUY","(indicating) You have to sign for it.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Oh, right.","the-doorman",102

"FRANK","Thank you, Kramer.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","(indicating a chair) Put it over there.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","So, how you feeling?","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Tired.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Uh huh. Your back hurt?","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","How did you know?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","You want me to wear a bra?!","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","No, no. A bra is for ladies.","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Meet, the bro.","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","So, is your father excited about coming home?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","George?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","She was a lovely woman.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Yuh. What about physically?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","Physically?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","Well, you've seen pictures.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","So what?","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","Big? No, just my height.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Bosomy?","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","Where do you get your genes from?!","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","I can't believe you left your post.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","He left me there. You see the mind games?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-doorman",102
"ESTELLE","(shocked) Oh, my god!","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","What were you doing watching the door anyway?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","He asked me to. We were getting along.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Alright, well what if we say...","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","I came to pick you up.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Yeah. That's what I just said.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","I know. I was just...","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Alright, well. Just, start again, then.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Okay, you came to pick me up at...","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Right.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","You see? Again.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","What? I said right.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.","the-doorman",102

"MRS. PAYTON","Why should I believe you?","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","(indicating Elaine) Actually, it was her friend.","the-doorman",102
"MRS. PAYTON","I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman","the-doorman",102
"MRS. PAYTON","He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination,","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Is it possible we were victims of a sting?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.","the-doorman",102
"DOORMAN","No. I was just messing with his head.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","We have to replace the couch.","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","Now we have to buy a new couch?!","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?","the-doorman",102
"JERRY","The one with the Poppie stain?!","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","But it's got a pee-stain on it.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","No, the cushion's turned over.","the-doorman",102
"ELAINE","(not sure) I guess.","the-doorman",102
"GEORGE","(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It","the-doorman",102

"KRAMER","(to Frank) I told you.","the-doorman",102
"FARKUS","And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","(vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.","the-doorman",102
"FARKUS","(indicating the bro) So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro?","the-doorman",102
"KRAMER","Uh.","the-doorman",102
"FRANK","Definitely velcro.","the-doorman",102

"GEORGE","Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming","the-doorman",102

Nobody really cares about killing insects, even the animal rights people don't care.

"ELAINE","Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Oh, god.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","All right.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","So, I'm getting an eye job.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","Georgie, I'm a divorcee.","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"ESTELLE","Well, I'm out there, George.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","No, you're not out there.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","I am, too!","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","This is the only time the doctor *has*.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"KRAMER","(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Tuesday? Uh...","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ESTELLE","Oh, I don't care.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"KRAMER","Cosmo Kramer.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"CLERK","(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","No! I'm not the Assman.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"CLERK","Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"DAVID","How do you feel?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Fine.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"DAVID","Something the matter?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","No.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"DAVID","Then what is it?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","No, nothing.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Hi.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","I was with David *Putty* last night.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Yeah, so.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","He did the move.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","What move?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","You know...*the* move.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Wait a second. *My* move?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","David Putty used *my* move?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Yes, yes.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Are you sure?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Well, wait---wait a second.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","What?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Isn't that a little...rash?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","No! He stole my move!","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Yeah, but...*I* like the move.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Can I just get it opened first?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","You feel better?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Nancy Klopper?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure,","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","You're gonna tell me...or not.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","I got a headboard.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Is it padded?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","No.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Good. How tall is she?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Five-foot four. Why?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Is it a clockwise swirl?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","What is it?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","When did you do this?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Oh... Why Fusilli?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry)","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Well, thank you very much.","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"KRAMER","Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Yeah. Proctologist.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"THE SAME WAY","""It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.""","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"KRAMER","Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"DAVID","You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"DAVID","Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Swirl.","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"GEORGE","What happened to Putty?","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"ELAINE","Why?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"ELAINE","An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"FRANK","Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"GEORGE","It just came to me.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"NANCY","I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","You mean in the end?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"NANCY","Uh-huh.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"GEORGE","A counter-clockwise swirl.","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"NANCY","What's that?","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"ELAINE","Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"JERRY","Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"FRANK","Where's your friend Kramer?","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"JERRY","What do you mean?","the-fusilli-jerry",105
"FRANK","In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know","the-fusilli-jerry",105

"JERRY","He had to use cork-screw pasta.","the-fusilli-jerry",105

Excuse me, but isn't this the flight? I already got four hours of this comin' to me... What am I paying for? How bout' an 'I got all my luggage club'? Can I get into that club? Where is that club? I would like to join that club. Airlines love to divide us into classes. You know like when you're sitting in coach, the stewardess always closes that stupid curtain.

"JERRY","That's it! No more questions! I don't care!","the-diplomat's-club",106

"CARL","Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.","the-diplomat's-club",106

"GEORGE","Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.","the-understudy",107

"ELAINE","Mr. Costanza, I, ...","the-understudy",107
"FRANK","Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy"".","the-understudy",107

"KRAMER","SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.","the-understudy",107
"KRAMER","So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)","the-understudy",107
"ELAINE","Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.","the-understudy",107

"FRANK","Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.","the-understudy",107
"KIM","That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.","the-understudy",107
"LOTUS","That man also refuses to take his shoes off.","the-understudy",107

"KRAMER","yeah, all right, yeah.... (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.","the-understudy",107
"BETTE","Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.","the-understudy",107

"ELAINE","(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella) ... I don't even know where I'm going.","the-understudy",107

"PETERMAN","That's my coat.","the-understudy",107
"ELAINE","You mean..?","the-understudy",107
"PETERMAN","Yes, I'm J. Peterman.","the-understudy",107

"GEORGE","So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.","the-understudy",107
"JERRY","Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.","the-understudy",107
"GENNICE","I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me.","the-understudy",107
"JERRY","Stop your crying will ya?","the-understudy",107
"GENNICE","What?","the-understudy",107
"GEORGE","You heard him.","the-understudy",107
"GENNICE","Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.","the-understudy",107

"JERRY","Hey, I had nothing to do with it.","the-understudy",107

"PETERMAN","Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.","the-understudy",107
"PETERMAN","That shirt. Where did you get it?","the-understudy",107
"ELAINE","Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.","the-understudy",107
"PETERMAN","That's NOT bad!","the-understudy",107
"KIM","Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.","the-understudy",107
"FRANK","I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.","the-understudy",107
"KIM","I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.","the-understudy",107
"FRANK","I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.","the-understudy",107
"KIM","Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.","the-understudy",107
"FRANK","Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.","the-understudy",107

"THE END"," THE END","the-understudy",107
"JERRY","Monkeys are really the end of the line in the pet world. I think when you're at the monkey level of pet ownership, have a kid. I mean, come on, you know, I mean, you're *so* close. If you need a pet that can roller skate and smoke cigars, it's time to think about a family. Monkeys, of course, were the first astronauts in the sixties, which I'm sure made perfect sense in the monkey brain. 'Maybe that is the next logical step for me, because I've been working with the Italian guy and the crank organ, and I think I'm ready to handle the maximum re-entry g-forces.","the-face-painter",108
"GEORGE","Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?","the-face-painter",108
"SIENA","That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.","the-face-painter",108
"GEORGE","And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.","the-face-painter",108
"SIENA","Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?","the-face-painter",108
"GEORGE","It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.","the-face-painter",108
"SIENA","Wow.","the-face-painter",108
"GEORGE","You find this interesting, don't you?","the-face-painter",108
"SIENA","Yes. yes, I do.","the-face-painter",108

"ELAINE","What?","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?","the-face-painter",108
"ELAINE","Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup!Keep it up!""?","the-face-painter",108
"ELAINE","Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.","the-face-painter",108

"JERRY","Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.","the-face-painter",108
"ELAINE","I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","Gotta support the team.","the-face-painter",108
"ELAINE","You know I really hate my clothes.","the-face-painter",108

"MR. PLESS","Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems","the-face-painter",108
"KRAMER","So, so what do you want me to do?","the-face-painter",108
"MR. PLESS","Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.","the-face-painter",108
"KRAMER","Yeah, well he started it.","the-face-painter",108
"MR. PLESS","Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate.","the-face-painter",108

"GEORGE","Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-face-painter",108

"GEORGE","Oh my god.","the-face-painter",108

"JERRY","Are you gonna say it again?","the-face-painter",108
"GEORGE","That's the question, Jimmy.","the-face-painter",108

"KRAMER","He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","I don't know if he's mad.","the-face-painter",108
"KRAMER","Alright, so what happened when you saw him?","the-face-painter",108
"JERRY","Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.","the-face-painter",108
"KRAMER","Uh huh.","the-face-painter",108

"JERRY","And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","Yeah, what else?","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","I was just curious.","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me.","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","I am really gonna make some changes.","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","Yes. Changes.","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","Well...","the-engagement",109
"KRAMER","They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","Really?","the-engagement",109
"KRAMER","Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.","the-engagement",109

"GEORGE","You're blown?","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","Wow!","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","You like that?","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","And she said ""Yes""?","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said ""Yes""! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?","the-engagement",109

"GEORGE",". . . she scooped her niblets?","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","What?","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. 9Did you not shake my hand on it uh?","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...","the-engagement",109

"NEWMAN","I knew you'd back out.","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","Kramer:, are we doing a bad thing?","the-engagement",109
"KRAMER","Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a real favor.","the-engagement",109

"ELAINE","But he's so small.","the-engagement",109
"NEWMAN","Yeah, but he's a fighter.","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?","the-engagement",109
"NEWMAN","Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the second courtyard.","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","How could that be the dog?","the-engagement",109

"SUSAN","Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?","the-engagement",109
"GEORGE","Oh, I sure hope so.","the-engagement",109

"FRIEND","What about that underwater escape?","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","Oh, man!","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","Very strange.","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","I know.","the-engagement",109

"JERRY","Sorry!","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","What? What?","the-engagement",109

"COP","You're under arrest.","the-engagement",109
"KRAMER","Arrest?","the-engagement",109
"COP","I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..","the-engagement",109
"JERRY","Newman: .","the-engagement",109
"NEWMAN","What took you so long?","the-engagement",109
"KRAMER","Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?","the-engagement",109
"NEWMAN","Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?","the-engagement",109
"THE END"," THE END","the-engagement",109
"ELAINE","Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Really? What happened?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Isn't he the one with the show on cable?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","That's great.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","I know.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","That looks pretty good.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","He's in.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","What's to discuss?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Come on! George: is getting married!","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Is he happy?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Can we change the subject, please?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yeah, he seems pretty happy.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Well, that's all that counts, I guess.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","What's the matter?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, nothin'.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Well, what do you want me to do?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Well, at least have some reaction to it.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Well, I don't.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Maybe you're a little jealous.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George:?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. Right.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, right.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Lainy!","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Jerry:!","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You don't wanna get married?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Oh, come on!","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, you come on.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You're such...","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Oh, hey!","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hey.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Elaine:, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, dear.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry:?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","We're gonna change the system.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Yes!","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, hello, Rabbi: Krischma.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Elaine:! Always a pleasure to see you.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, I suppose.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","No, Rabbi:, I'm not myself.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.","the-postponement",110
"AT JERRY","'s apartment. George trots in after his lunch with Kiki","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hey!","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I want your honest opinion about something.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Have I ever been less than forthright?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","It's good, right?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","You do?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yes, I do.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Well, I told it to Susan: before, and she didn't like it.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hmm.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, ""Can we change the subject?""","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","See, now that I don't care for.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","It should resolve of its own volition.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","That's exactly what I said, except I used the word ""momentum"".","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Momentum - same thing.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yeah, I know.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You're turning.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","If you need more time, you should have more time.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","What, you think I could postpone it?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Sure you can. Why not?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","I don't see why not.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","So, I could do that?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Sure, go ahead.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Spring. Of course.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Beautiful.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","She's not gonna like it.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","No, she's not.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Hey, hey.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Oh, all the way.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Is that so?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Definitely.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You're kidding?","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","No, no, I would turn you in.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You would turn me in?","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","I can't believe your a friend of mine.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","What kind of person are you going around killing people?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Well, I am sure I had a good reason.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","But you know me!","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","I thought I DID!","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","How wonderful.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, I don't know what that means.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","You know my temple has many single functions.","the-postponement",110

"KRAMER","Since when are you so trendy?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.","the-postponement",110

"JERRY","Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","I've always wanted to see this.","the-postponement",110

"KRAMER","Well, yeah, lets do it uh?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Maybe I will.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Hi,","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","How was your day?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Good, good day. How was your day?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","The Lowers, really?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","You don't want to go?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","No, I want to go.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","So what did Jerry have to say?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Yeah.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the ...","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Still marry , still marry.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","You don't love me.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Sstill love. Still love.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.","the-postponement",110

"JERRY","I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I didn't have any sex.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I didn't have make-up sex.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!","the-postponement",110
"WOMAN","(crying)","the-postponement",110
"MAN","I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.","the-postponement",110
"MAN","Are you going to eat thoise fries?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)","the-postponement",110

"RABBI","I hope she's feeling better.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","What do you mean?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","She didn't tell you?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","No.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","is that so?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Really?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","She came off as pretty desperate.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","I didn't know any of this.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Hum, well it all comes as news to me.","the-postponement",110
"G","(enters) Hi.","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Hi, how was your day?","the-postponement",110

"GEORGE","You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah?","the-postponement",110
"SUSAN","Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","All right. (smiles behind her back)","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","I've got that magazine article for you.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Are you","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Understand you had a little talk with him too.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah, talked earlier.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yes I know, I know.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE",". . . What does that mean?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Nothing, nothing.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","He didn't mention . . .","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yes he did.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","He told you about our conversation?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","We had quite a little chat.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","He told you about . . .","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","He told you all that? How could he?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Can he do that?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","He did it.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","That's what's so fascinating.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Why not?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Well that's stupid","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","That's the rule.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.","the-postponement",110
"E","Yeah...","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Was that a problem for you?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Mrs. Winston?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" for you.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Don Ramsey?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him...","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","my god, you didn't.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Oh, yow, oow Ah!","the-postponement",110
"USHER","Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?","the-postponement",110

"USHER","Whatya got? One of those Caf Latte's in your shirt?","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","I don't have anything. Ask him.","the-postponement",110
"USHER","All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","What?!","the-postponement",110
"USHER","Here you go.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Ow","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","You didn't say this to George, did you?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yeah that! So, . . .","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Hey oh.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Alright, thanks a lot.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Well, I guess I'm getting older.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.","the-postponement",110
"ELAINE","Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh...","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Nope. I wept like a baby.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","What?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","You cried?","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","Suing? What for?","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","The coffee was too hot.","the-postponement",110
"JERRY","It's supposed to be hot.","the-postponement",110
"KRAMER","Not THAT hot.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi: from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.","the-postponement",110
"RABBI","A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George:. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.","the-postponement",110
"THE END"," THE END","the-postponement",110
"GEORGE","And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Ya know, I was just a little surprised.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","What about all the loser stuff?","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser"".","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Where you going?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","I'm going shopping with Susan.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","What kind of shopping?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Clothes shopping.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Where are you going?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Ross'.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Oh that's a nice store.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Yeah, it's her uncle's.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Discount?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","(As he leaves) One would hope.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah that's right.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Half milk, half coffee?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Hm Hm. You take a sip?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yes I did.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well I think I take a normal sip.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","It's definitely preposterous.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","So. Then what happened?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Was there a top on it?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","No. They put the top on.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Ah No no, I haven't.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Jackie.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","Well you could use a little flash.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","Name one.","the-maestro",111
"MR ROSS","So, you find anything?","the-maestro",111

"SUSAN","What?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","The security guard.","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","What about him?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Why does he have to stand?","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","Because he's a security guard.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day?","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Aren't you concerned about the security guard?","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","Not really. (Walks away)","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What","the-maestro",111
"SUSAN","All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you","the-maestro",111

"KRAMER","Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.","the-maestro",111

"GEORGE","(Obviously lying) No.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","No.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Are you sensing anything right now?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I know you will.","the-maestro",111

"KRAMER","Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Why are they settling?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Cause their afraid of bad publicity.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah that's right.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!","the-maestro",111

"MAESTRO","Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Excuse me?","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","Well, ya know I am a conductor.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Yeah, so?","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)","the-maestro",111

"JERRY","I thought they wanted to settle.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well what happens if they want to see it?","the-maestro",111

"KRAMER","Yeah!!","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","(To guard) Tired?","the-maestro",111

"GUARD","Nope.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Would you like a chair?","the-maestro",111
"GUARD","I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?","the-maestro",111
"GUARD","Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","That's exactly my point.","the-maestro",111
"GUARD","Well who wouldn't?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you","the-maestro",111

"JACKIE","I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well I ...","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.","the-maestro",111

"ELAINE","Really?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Yeah, I called him Maestro.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","You didn't mind?","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","O.K. from now on I want you to call me ""Jerry the Great"".","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great"".","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Why not you call him Maestro.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","He is a Maestro.","the-maestro",111

"JERRY","You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Why?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","In all of Tuscany? I wonder.","the-maestro",111
"MR STAR","I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.","the-maestro",111

"KRAMER","No.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","Free coffee?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-maestro",111

"KRAMER","Well I didn't hear any Plus.","the-maestro",111
"JACKIE","20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.","the-maestro",111

"MAESTRO","Oh yeah?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","You didn't find one, did you?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","No. I'm not really looking.","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","Nor should you.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","It's booked solid!","the-maestro",111
"ELAINE","It's BOOKED Jerry!","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","How'd you get yours?","the-maestro",111
"MAESTRO","Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some","the-maestro",111

"GEORGE","So what do you care?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I have no idea.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Oh, no way it's that big.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","It's a big region.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","I don't know why I bother even talking to you.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","All right.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","So I spoke to the security guard.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Yeah and?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair,","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","So are you gonna get him a chair?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Oh I think I'd go for the back.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Swivel?","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","You mean one of those vinyl things?","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Yes.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Vinyl yeah, maybe.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.","the-maestro",111
"JERRY","Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","What do you think about a rocking chair?","the-maestro",111
"KRAMER","(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes,","the-maestro",111

"GEORGE","I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this","the-maestro",111
"CLERK","I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Innocent mistake.","the-maestro",111
"GEORGE","Well, here you go. What do you think?","the-maestro",111

"ELAINE","Hello.","the-wink",112
"JAMES","This is your wake up service. It's 7:15.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.","the-wink",112
"JAMES","Hot date last night?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","I wish.","the-wink",112
"JAMES","A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe you're waking up alone.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Really? Thank you, wake up service . . . person.","the-wink",112
"JAMES","Call me James.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Oh, all right, James. He he he.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Your wake up guy asked you out?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,","the-wink",112
"JERRY","I don't know. Blind date?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Ah. . .","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Now you're off on a topic.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Uh hu.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","I think she'd figure it out.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","What? What is this?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","A healthy person.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","(rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Oh, sorry","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Boy, it stings.","the-wink",112
"WILHELM","George, have you seen Morgan?","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","No.","the-wink",112
"WILHELM","He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","No, not that I know of. (winks)","the-wink",112
"WILHELM","Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)","the-wink",112
"WILHELM","I understand.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","I think I can tell.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Twenty-five percent.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","You're way off.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","UNDATEABLE!","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Then how are all these people getting together?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Alcohol.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","(to George who is winking) What is your problem?","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","No problem here.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","I had no idea.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","Right there. Right there. You just did it again.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","You're eye still hurts?","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Pulp couldn't make it across the table.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.","the-wink",112
"KRAMER","Hi guys.","the-wink",112

"KRAMER","Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)","the-wink",112
"KRAMER","No, of course not. (winks back)","the-wink",112
"KRAMER","You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.","the-wink",112
"STEINBRENNER","I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.","the-wink",112
"KRAMER","Why?","the-wink",112
"STEINBRENNER","What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.","the-wink",112
"GEORGE","Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?","the-wink",112
"MM","Hello.","the-wink",112

"JERRY","Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.","the-wink",112
"HOLLY","That is so funny. Did you just make that up?","the-wink",112
"JERRY","I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)","the-wink",112
"HOLLY","That was in Grandma's study.","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","What did you do, ransack the place after she died?","the-wink",112

"GEORGE","Napkins?","the-wink",112
"ELAINE","I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.","the-wink",112

"ELAINE","I know, it's just something you have to say...","the-hot-tub",113
"WILHELM","George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items,","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AMPM mixed-up.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","What do you do?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and...","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Always works?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","uh-uh. What's with the bucket?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.","the-hot-tub",113

"KRAMER","Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","You put a hot tub... in your living room?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating,","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","Is that tolerable?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","He uh...doesn't have any running water?","the-hot-tub",113

"AMPM."," AMPM.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Ah...the volume.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Ah, separate knob.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Jerry...","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","It's a simple question...","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","I've got an alarm, ok?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","It works.","the-hot-tub",113

"WILHELM","George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.","the-hot-tub",113
"WILHELM","I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Hey. Sorry I'm late.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","You're 40 minutes late. What happened?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","No.","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race,","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Oh are you?!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Yes I am.","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!","the-hot-tub",113

"ELAINE","Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","What happened?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","This was set for 2 minutes. See?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Yeah. I hope so ?!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over","the-hot-tub",113

"GEORGE","(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.","the-hot-tub",113
"GARDNER","I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...","the-hot-tub",113

"GEORGE","I really like those sons of bitches.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Sons of bitches?","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch.","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Heeeeey...","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","How many sweaters you got on?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","What's goin'on?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Your core temperature?","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.","the-hot-tub",113

"CLAYTON","(to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!","the-hot-tub",113

"ZEKE","(to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?","the-hot-tub",113
"CLAYTON","Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!","the-hot-tub",113

"JERRY","Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","I got the call...!","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","Jean-Paul?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50...","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","How about adult contemporary?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now...","the-hot-tub",113
"MAN","(on the phone) Front desk...?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.","the-hot-tub",113
"MAN","Yes sir.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...","the-hot-tub",113
"MAN","Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.","the-hot-tub",113
"MAN","Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...","the-hot-tub",113
"MAN","Are you through? (annoyed)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","humm...","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","What if he doesn't call now out of spite?","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Judy, hi, listen...","the-hot-tub",113
"JUDY","You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Oh I didn't tell anyone.","the-hot-tub",113
"JUDY","Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door)","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the ""pop!"" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Frankly, I'm a little concerned.","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","What happened to your mental alarm?!","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)","the-hot-tub",113

"GEORGE","Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...","the-hot-tub",113
"STEINBRENNER","Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Then how did she find out, Jerry?!","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Maybe you should check with the rabbi.","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Oh no, thank you.","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)","the-hot-tub",113
"KRAMER","Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)","the-hot-tub",113
"JERRY","Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!","the-hot-tub",113
"ELAINE","Go Jean-Paaaaaul!","the-hot-tub",113
"STEINBRENNER","How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...","the-hot-tub",113
"STEINBRENNER","I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.","the-hot-tub",113
"THE END"," THE END","the-hot-tub",113
"GEORGE","All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?","the-soup-nazi",114
"SHEILA","You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","You're a shmoopy!","the-soup-nazi",114
"SHEILA","You're a shmoopy!","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","You're a shmoopy!","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?","the-soup-nazi",114
"SHEILA","No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-soup-nazi",114
"SHEILA","Hi Elaine.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Hi Sheila.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","All right, then. I'll see you later.","the-soup-nazi",114
"SHEILA","Bye shmoopy.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Bye shmoopy.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Okay. We ready to go?","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","Yes. Please. Please, let's go.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","No. We gotta go to the soup place.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","What soup place?","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Stunned by soup?","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Huh. All right. Come on.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Why? What happens if you don't order right?","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","He yells and you don't get your soup.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","What?","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","What?","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","The main thing is to keep the line moving.","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Oh, boy, I'm really scared!","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Elaine.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Ar-moire.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","How much is this?","the-soup-nazi",114
"FURNITURE GUY","I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","He gave you the nice face discount.","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","What about the soup?","the-soup-nazi",114
"ELAINE","I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","(in French accent) Pardon.","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","This line is huge.","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","It's like this all the time.","the-soup-nazi",114
"GEORGE","Isn't that that Bania guy?","the-soup-nazi",114
"JERRY","Oh, no. It is. Just be still.","the-soup-nazi",114

"THE END"," THE END","the-pool-guy",116
"JERRY","I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Is that tomorrow?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","It's hard enough living next door.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","New jeans?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Still a 31 waist?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Lena Small?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","You're a taking person.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","She's gonna ask how you got her number.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","What's he look like?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","You're buying a speedboat?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","I don't know about that.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Well...","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Yeah. So you really like this guy.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Very much.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","How's the...sexual chemistry?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Are you still on the pill?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Uh, Kramer...","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","But wasn't that taken off the market?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Not as thin as you think.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","The tag, huh?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Mmm-hmm.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","What are you talking about?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Oh, how could he be so vain?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Why not?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Where did you get that from?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Well, we're a couple. It's understood.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I never heard of that.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Well, you've never been a couple.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I've coupled! I've coupled!","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Hey. What's the matter?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I had a fight with Susan.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","What about?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I got a date with that girl, Lena.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Lena, how'd you meet her?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You met her a few weeks ago, but...?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I didn't call her till today.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","So, uh...wanna double?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","What?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","So what are you gonna do?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Just for these sponges?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I dunno.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","You don't know?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","What are you all out of breath from?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I got a 31 waist, mister!","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Can I help you?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Actually, we have a case left.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Sixty.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Three.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Make it ten.","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Ten?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Twenty sponges should be plenty.","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Did you say twenty?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.","the-sponge",117
"PHARMACIST","Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Mmm! Very nice.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","It's All-Tempa-Cheer.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","They serve soup at 6 a.m.?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Yeah. That's all they have.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?""","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I'd get tired of it.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","How could you not?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Guess who volunteered last week?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Mick Jagger.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","No. Maya Angelou.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Oh, the poet!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","I don't know.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","So, did you get to talk to her?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Talk to who?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Is it a lot of cream soups?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Maya Angelou, the poet.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","No, I didn't get the chance.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","I'm going to the ladies room.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","I'll go with you. (They leave.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What are you looking at me like that for?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What are you talking about?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","But you told me anyway?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Thank you, honey.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Can we stop by a drug store first?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What for?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","I'm out of birth control stuff.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Me run in? Why don't you run in?","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Of course I do.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","You do? What?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","The what?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Just get me some sponges, please.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Off the market? The sponge?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Yeah, so you gotta use something else.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You're never gonna make it!","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well...Susan.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Ah, Susan uses the sponge.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Susan loves the sponge.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.","the-sponge",117
"MONICA","He got her number off an AIDS walk list?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","He what?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","How'd you find out?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","George!","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Pardon?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -","the-sponge",117
"LENA","It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.)","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You went all night?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Really? How'd she do that?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","A friend of a friend of Susan's.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","My Susan?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Why'd you tell her?!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Well you know what this means, don't you?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You're cut off, you're out of the loop!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I don't know, George.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","So, Lena was upset, huh?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","You know what? That was the amazing thing.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What, it didn't bother her?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","What?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","She's too good.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Too good...","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I see what you mean.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Where's the depravity?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","On the other hand...","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","What?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Thanks again for last night!","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Hey, I didn't even use one.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I thought you said it was imminent.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Sponge-worthy?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Uh, Cosmo Kramer?","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Uh, no thanks.","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","No.","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","I have to?","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","Yes.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","See, that's why I don't want to.","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)","the-sponge",117
"ORGANIZER","Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Just once...for the make-up sex.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Come on, just once?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","No, no...I hate the condom.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Why?","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I can never get the package open in time.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Well, you just tear it open.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's a lot of pressure there.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.","the-sponge",117
"BOB","Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","So, you think you're sponge-worthy?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Run down your case for me again...?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","You going to do something about your sideburns?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","And the bathroom in your apartment?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Cleaned it this morning.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Everything, yeah. It's spotless.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Hi.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Thanks. So, you were saying...?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","What? Nothing.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","No, you said I was a good person...","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh...","the-sponge",117
"LENA","You seem like you want to tell me something.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Tell you something...I do.","the-sponge",117
"LENA","What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?","the-sponge",117
"LENA","Yeah.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Come on, George, just tear it open.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I'm trying, dammit.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Tear it.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Here give it to me.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)","the-sponge",117
"SUSAN","Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","It's too late.","the-sponge",117
"BOB","So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","No! Never.","the-sponge",117
"BOB","But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?","the-sponge",117
"KRAMER","This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!","the-sponge",117
"CEDRIC","What are we gonna do with him?","the-sponge",117
"BOB","I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","It completely turned her off.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","I don't wanna be a 32.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","I'd kill to be a 32.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)","the-sponge",117
"GEORGE","Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Good morning.","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","How'd you sleep?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Great. You?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Yep.","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","No regrets?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","What do you mean?","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","Oh...I don't think so.","the-sponge",117
"BILLY","Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.","the-sponge",117
"ELAINE","I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)","the-sponge",117
"THE END"," THE END","the-sponge",117
"JERRY","(unwrapping a piece of gum) I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions. (pops gum in his mouth) It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. (as sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","You think she's happy?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Who?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(indicates with his head) The cashier.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Ruthie Cohen?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(surprised) You know her name?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Sure.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I don't think I've ever spoken to her.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Maybe that's why she's happy.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","What is this?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex","the-gum",118
"JERRY","That stinky old movie-house?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Geoffrey who?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Really?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Oh, then I'm not worried.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Hey Kramer.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","How you doing?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Hi Jerry.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Lloyd.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","George.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","(offering packet) Gum?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(peering) That's an interesting package.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","George?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I don't chew gum.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Nah, don't bother.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","No, it's no problem.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I don't want it.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Alright.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y (he spits it into the waste bin)","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","What kind is that?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Yeah? Well, I got news for you.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'","the-gum",118
"JERRY","And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Right, gotta get going.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I thought your parents were outta town?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Why d'you think I'm going now?","the-gum",118
"POP","Georgie!","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Hey, Mr Lazzari.","the-gum",118
"POP","Back in the old neighborhood, ah?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.","the-gum",118
"POP","Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.","the-gum",118
"POP","The actor, right?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Something like that.","the-gum",118
"POP","Mind if I look under the hood?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.","the-gum",118
"POP","Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","George Costanza, is that you?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Boy, those were some crazy times.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Oh, can Lloyd really do that?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","What? No, no, I'd rather...","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Hi Elaine.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot","the-gum",118
"JERRY","We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Poor Lloyd.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I know. Completely bonkers!","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Pop? What happened to Pop?","the-gum",118
"DEENA","I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm","the-gum",118
"POP","Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Uhn, it was too much for him.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","What?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Pop! POP!!","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","'s a great movie, huh?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Sorry you forgot those glasses.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I don't know what I was thinking.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","How'd you like that gum?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(noncommittal) Errh.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Oh. Oh God.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","You alright?","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a","the-gum",118
"COP","Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, put these glasses on.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(taking them) Well, what's this for?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","So what?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Well, he thinks you wear those.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","They're from the lost and found at the Alex.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you","the-gum",118
"CASHIER","I don't think so.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill","the-gum",118
"CASHIER","Not unless you buy something.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I don't.","the-gum",118
"CASHIER","Take a look.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I know I gave it to you.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door)","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry, look who's here.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Ah, Lloyd.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh, boy.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him,","the-gum",118
"JERRY","'s not necessary.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I know that, Kramer.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Well, if you don't want to...","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Yes I do, Kramer.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","So...","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah?","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","How about that Elaine today, huh?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I didn't see anything.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,","the-gum",118
"DEENA","You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh,","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Warning signs?","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","All my friends do that.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","George, I'm only trying to help...","the-gum",118
"DEENA","I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","You see that woman on the horse? (points)","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've","the-gum",118
"DEENA","So again it all comes back to Lloyd.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back","the-gum",118
"JERRY","So you say she was on a horse?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.","the-gum",118

"ELAINE","Hey.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(sits beside Jerry) What?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Maybe it's in the lost and found.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too,","the-gum",118
"JERRY","You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at","the-gum",118

"KRAMER","Brown?","the-gum",118
"HAARWOOD","Mmm, yes, yes.","the-gum",118

"GEORGE","Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, merry Christmas.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(staring at the wreck) Whatever.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","What, he's not here yet?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Why?","the-gum",118

"LLOYD","Anybody see Elaine today?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing,","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Absolutely. Let's just stick around.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog","the-gum",118

"ATTENDANT","Are you outta your mind?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?","the-gum",118
"ATTENDANT","This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Kramer, maybe...","the-gum",118

"ELAINE","Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?","the-gum",118
"FLORIST","How would you happen to know that?","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Well, uhm... I...","the-gum",118
"FLORIST","(accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Uh... I...","the-gum",118

"JERRY","Lloyd?","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your","the-gum",118
"DEENA","So, you want my father to pay for this?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did","the-gum",118
"DEENA","And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","What cashier?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","To park her horse?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","No, she wasn't on the horse.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","That's right.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(points) And him!","the-gum",118
"DEENA","The man with the flowers?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Who?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...","the-gum",118
"DEENA","(doubtful) That was your best friend?","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","That man was wearing glasses.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","I'll run in and get the gum.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","Alright.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Got any money?","the-gum",118

"DEENA","I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Believe me, I am not crazy.","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Well, I guess it's possible.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Here y'go.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(indistinct) Got all this?","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.","the-gum",118
"JERRY","(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?","the-gum",118
"JERRY","It's a lotta gum!","the-gum",118

"KRAMER","(an idea occurs) You don't say.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute,","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?","the-gum",118
"GUY","I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess","the-gum",118
"DEENA","Oh my God!","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.","the-gum",118
"GEORGE","Th... this isn't mine.","the-gum",118

"LLOYD","Hey Kramer.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","I need to talk to you.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","You know, that button looks very familiar.","the-gum",118
"HAARWOOD","Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've","the-gum",118
"HAARWOOD","Yes, it was in the lost and found.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Shall I undo it?","the-gum",118
"HAARWOOD","Oh yes, of course you can.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Oh, thank you.","the-gum",118
"HAARWOOD","I'm a little ticklish.","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.","the-gum",118
"LLOYD","We've really gotta get the Elaine a boyfriend.","the-gum",118
"KRAMER","Oh, tell me about it.","the-gum",118
"THE END"," THE END","the-gum",118
"ELAINE","(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Maybe he'll write a song about you.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","So I take it he's spongeworthy?","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Oh, no?","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Come on. Come on.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","I don't wanna!","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Elaine, you're among friends.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Oh.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Yeah. It's surprising.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Sure. Why not? You're there.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Exactly.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","What stuff?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Course I will. These are staples.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Lindsay olives, Jerry.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","$17.50. You can't beat that.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Look...look at this can of tuna!","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Hey, Clyde!","the-rye",119
"CLYDE","Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.","the-rye",119
"CLYDE","How ya doin'?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Hi.","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.","the-rye",119

"CLYDE","Oh yeah?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.","the-rye",119
"CLYDE","Is that right?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.","the-rye",119
"CLYDE","Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.","the-rye",119

"GEORGE","Yeah. Yeah, one second.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","Well, come on!","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","My in-laws. Oh, my....","the-rye",119
"FRANK","So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","I don't like that tie.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","How do you know what kind of ties they wear?","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Huh?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's?","the-rye",119
"FRANK","No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","This is gonna be fun.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","So what did he have to say?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","What did you do that for?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","What?","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Oh","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Well, Clyde might not tell him.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","How do you know that?","the-rye",119
"JERRY","I should have helped Kramer with those packages.","the-rye",119
"ELAINE","Ohh!","the-rye",119
"DENNIS","Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Uh-huh.","the-rye",119
"DENNIS","I wonder, could you pick up my mail?","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Yeah. Sure. Sure.","the-rye",119
"DENNIS","In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Drive the horse?","the-rye",119
"DENNIS","It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Oh, giddyup. Yeah.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Oh.","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","What is this thing anyway?","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","It's Cornish gamehen.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","What is that, like a little chicken?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Gamebird?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","Yes.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","How hard could it be to kill this thing?","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","More wine anyone?","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Yeah. I'll take some.","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","Hmmm?","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Thank you.","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","How do you like the Merlot?","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Oh, mother.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Why don't we talk about it another time.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Something's missing all right.","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","That's perverse.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Did anybody see Firestorm?","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Oh mother of God.","the-rye",119
"KRAMER","Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by","the-rye",119
"JOHN","Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Thank God that's over.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","What is this? The marble rye?","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","We forgot to bring it in.","the-rye",119
"FRANK","No, I brought it in. They never put it out.","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Where is it?","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","I don't know. Where'd you put it?","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Right over there.","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","Well, it's gone.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","You stole the bread?","the-rye",119
"FRANK","What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Because we brought it for them!","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.","the-rye",119
"MRS. ROSS","Is it possible they took it back?","the-rye",119
"SUSAN","Who would bring a bread and take it back?","the-rye",119
"MR. ROSS","Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.","the-rye",119
"ESTELLE","People take buses to get that rye.","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Maybe they forgot to put it out!","the-rye",119
"FRANK","Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I","the-rye",119
"JERRY","He stole back the rye?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Why?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","So, do the Ross's know?","the-rye",119
"GEORGE","I don't know. They're all very suspicious.","the-rye",119
"JERRY","Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.","the-rye",119

"JERRY","No, I don't.","the-caddy",120
"SUE ELLEN","Oh...","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Is there something I can help you with?","the-caddy",120

"JERRY","Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.","the-caddy",120

"KRAMER","I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Kramer, it is not what you think.","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","You're just out for sex!","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","You're just out for money!","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER AND JERRY","Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!","the-caddy",120

"ESTELLE","Yesss?","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some","the-caddy",120
"ESTELLE","I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first","the-caddy",120
"ESTELLE","Are you sure you're talking about George?","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?","the-caddy",120
"FRANK","What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it.","the-caddy",120

"JERRY","Hello?","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Hey, it's George.","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Where have you been?!?","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","What?","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","I just got the most bizarre message from you father,","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Dead?","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","My car is a little crumpled?!?","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Well you gotta call your parents.","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Nnnooo! They could use the break!","the-caddy",120
"PETERMAN","Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Yeah, it's a bra.","the-caddy",120
"PETERMAN","I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","What is this all about?","the-caddy",120
"PETERMAN","I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Come in, come in.","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Mr. Steinbrenner--","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new","the-caddy",120
"GEORGE","I didn't get the job?","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our","the-caddy",120
"STEINBRENNER","But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Yes, that's correct.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","Three under par.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","If they're lucky.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","I...don't remember.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","I don't know. Maybe.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that","the-caddy",120
"JUDGE","This court will come to order!","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","No further questions, your honor.","the-caddy",120
"JUDGE","You may step down.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","I think we got this wrapped up.","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?","the-caddy",120
"STAN","You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","What do you mean?","the-caddy",120
"STAN","Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","No, no, no, no!","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Stan? Who the hell is Stan?","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","He's my caddy.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!","the-caddy",120
"KRAMER","G- cada-","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.","the-caddy",120
"JUDGE","This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.","the-caddy",120
"SUE ELLEN","Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on.","the-caddy",120
"JACKIE","Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Oh, no, I don't think so.","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah, thanks.","the-caddy",120
"ELAINE","Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.","the-caddy",120
"THE END"," THE END","the-caddy",120
"JERRY","I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. ""Nice tie."" ""Well, thank you. Thank you very much."" The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come say ""Hey, nice person."" It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and match the colours up.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(awed) Oh, look at this!","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!","the-seven",121
"JERRY","(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","What d'you think?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.","the-seven",121
"CHRISTIE","I think your friend needs some help over there.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","A little baby girl?","the-seven",121
"KEN","Doctor says it could be any day now.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are","the-seven",121
"CARRIE","Doesn't make you anything.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","So, have you picked out a name yet?","the-seven",121
"CARRIE","Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","Aww.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(negative) Hu-ho, boy.","the-seven",121
"KEN","You don't like Kimberley?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Ech. What else you got?","the-seven",121
"KEN","How about Joan?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","(warning) George!","the-seven",121

"KEN","What?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.","the-seven",121
"CARRIE","I don't know, it sounds a little strange.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you","the-seven",121
"KEN","Yeah, but uh... Soda?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Yeah, that's right. It's working.","the-seven",121
"CARRIE","We'll put it on the list.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","I solve problems. That's just what I do.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","You're really going to town with that turkey there.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","It's on the door.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Ah, 's no good.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","No. That's bush league.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without","the-seven",121
"JERRY","(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy","the-seven",121
"JERRY","What arrangement?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I","the-seven",121
"JERRY","(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Oh, hey.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Hey. What's with your neck?","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Ach, maybe.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","I don't know.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Awright.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Aw, you really hurting, huh?","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Alright, lean forward, relax.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(worried) What? What?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Encounter shiatsu.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","Ah hah.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(seriously worried) Wha...?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","He's a genius. Here we go...","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","From pain, will come pleasure.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Uh? Voila.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-seven",121

"ELAINE","(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","You really think he wants the bike?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Oh yeah.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","It took him like ten seconds!","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","I think they really went for that Soda.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","Yeah.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","What is that? Sign language?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","No, Seven.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","Seven Costanza? You're serious?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","...especially a girl. Or a boy.","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","I don't think so.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","What, you don't like the name?","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","It's not a name. It's a number.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","It's awful. I hate it!","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(angry) Well, that's the name!","the-seven",121
"SUSAN","(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Alright, you having a good time there?","the-seven",121

"JERRY","Oh, I forgot to call Christie.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do","the-seven",121

"KRAMER","Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And then I","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Sort of a mooching inventory.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Alright.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the","the-seven",121
"CHRISTIE","Yes, thank you.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","The same outfit?","the-seven",121
"JERRY","The exact same outfit.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","How many days was it between encounters.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Three.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","Very curious.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Indeed.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","How about 'Mickey'?","the-seven",121
"GEORGE","'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Hey buddy.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","No, that's yours. My half is gone.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","What?","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your","the-seven",121
"JERRY","You cannot buy half a can of soda.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Well, why not.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes","the-seven",121
"JERRY","...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Alright.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","...You bite it, you bought it.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.","the-seven",121
"JERRY","Thank you.","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-seven",121

"ELAINE","Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like","the-seven",121
"KRAMER","Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He","the-seven",121
"ELAINE","This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't","the-seven",121

"JERRY","I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","What?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","He's not buying us a Cadillac.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","What are you, nuts?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","How d'you know?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","Why can't I buy my father a car?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","Your father doesn't need a car.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","Yes, I do!","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"JACK","Some car.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","You wanna take a ride?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JACK","No, thank you.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","C'mon, take a ride.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JACK","I don't wanna take a ride.","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"GEORGE","(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"KRAMER","Y'hello.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"NICK","(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah,","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"JACK","C'mon Morty, the jig is up!","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","What're you talking about?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JACK","I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HERB","What's going on, Jack?","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"RALPH","What proof do you have?","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"JACK","Your son?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","Yeah.","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"HERB","Jack's right! He stinks!","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"RALPH","It's his material.","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"JERRY","Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Hello?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","Oh, hi Evelyn.","the-cadillac-part-1",122

"HELEN","What'd he say?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","He's voting to impeach.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","I did so thank him!","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","Ah, he's deaf anyway.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","Who's that?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Mrs Choate.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","Who's she?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"MORTY","That's a good idea.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Yes, they're having a party.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"HELEN","We weren't invited.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"EVELYN","Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because of the car.","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"THE END"," THE END","the-cadillac-part-1",122
"JERRY","Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Hello?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Elaine? Wh..what's going on?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Well, it's just two hours by plane...","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Gee, I dunno what to tell you.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Yeah?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Yeahhh.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Goodbye.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(smiling and flirty) Hi.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Hi.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","So, what d'you think?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Uh, I don't think so.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(disappointed) Oh.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","I'll be back on Monday.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(breathy) Bye.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Bye.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"KRAMER","Hello.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JOHN","Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"KRAMER","Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JOHN","Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"KRAMER","Oh, you don't say.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JOHN","(a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"KRAMER","(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JOHN","(confused) What're you talking about?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine)","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Hey, where you going?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","I got stuff to do.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","What? You can't leave yet.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Why not?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","We have to discuss my alibi.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Alibi? What does that have to do with me?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Yes.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","What is the difference?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(dismissive) It's no good.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(pointedly) Okay. Fine.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","What?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(weary) Okay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Alright?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Okay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Okay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Fine.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Good.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Fine, fine, fine.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Okay. How about this?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","What?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","I don't have a boyfriend.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(not convinced) Ech.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","It's good. Believe me.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","I thought my idea was just as good.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","The dentist thing?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Alright, the dentist thing was not good.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","That's your boyfriend.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","What does he do?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","He's an importer.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Just imports? No exports?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","It's very complicated.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","What're you doing? Are you making coffee?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Yeah.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Morty, you're driving me crazy.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","There she is.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","Ahh, they're a dime a dozen.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"JERRY","Shut up, you old bag!","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","(shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Nice to meet you.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","Hello.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","They're like savages.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Yeah, there's some sickos out there.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","(peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Maybe you've seen him on television.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Jerry's a comedian.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","Naw, I don't watch TV.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Jerry, don't go.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Ah, I think I'll go.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MRS. CHOATE","So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Hey, where're you going?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Elaine? What for?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","I didn't even know she was dating anyone.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","So what does he do?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","He's an importer-exporter.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","What kind of problems are they having?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Are you having an affair with Elaine?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Huh?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"NICK","(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Alright, are you ready to eat?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","I don't understand why we have to eat now.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MORTY","Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","You're not buying us dinner.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"JERRY","(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HELEN","Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MARISA","(laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MARISA","Did you just make that up?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","What, you think I'm doing material here?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MARISA","(laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","(modest) And I'm a little tired.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MARISA","So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"MARISA","What?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"GEORGE","I'm, you know, engaged.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"JACK","Where you gonna get a better meal than that?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"DORIS","Better than Danny's.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"JACK","Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"MORTY","We'll see.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"ELAINE","Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","Oh, sure.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"ELAINE","Yeah, Art Vandelay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"SUSAN","(not convinced) Yeah.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"ELAINE","What'd I say?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"SUSAN","The importing.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"RALPH","What does that mean?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HERB","It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"RALPH","So why don't you say that?","the-cadillac-part-2",123
"HERB","Hey, I'm running the meeting.","the-cadillac-part-2",123

"KRAMER","He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.","the-shower-head",124
"HELEN","It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.","the-shower-head",124
"MORTY","First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?","the-shower-head",124
"MORTY","Who is it?","the-shower-head",124
"SUPER","It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the","the-shower-head",124
"MORTY","Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.","the-shower-head",124
"PETERMAN","So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.","the-shower-head",124
"ELAINE","Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?","the-shower-head",124
"PETERMAN","I'm afraid I can't take you.","the-shower-head",124
"ELAINE","What? Why not?","the-shower-head",124
"PETERMAN","Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you","the-shower-head",124
"ELAINE","But I wanted to see the bushmen.","the-shower-head",124
"PETERMAN","Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.","the-shower-head",124
"JERRY","Well, it's been a great visit.","the-shower-head",124
"MORTY","Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to","the-shower-head",124
"JERRY","Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move.","the-shower-head",124
"HELEN","George must be happy about that.","the-shower-head",124
"JERRY","You have no idea.","the-shower-head",124
"FRANK","Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.","the-shower-head",124
"ESTELLE","What does he want with your swim trunks?","the-shower-head",124
"FRANK","Why should they go to waste?!?","the-shower-head",124
"THE END"," THE END","the-shower-head",124
"JERRY","Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Jerry!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly)","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Modest) Oh, thanks.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Blunt) I believe you.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Uh-huh.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","A billiard parlor?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Well, that's.. Elaine!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Oh, hi, Frank.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Confused) What photo?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said ""Costanza""?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Who is that?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","So, you weren't born here?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","The Maestro? What Maestro?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Really? Why?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Who?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","You know the Three Tenors?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Nodding) The other guy.","the-doll",125
"STEWARDESS","(Overly nice) Could I take that box for you?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.","the-doll",125
"STEWARDESS","Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh, okay..","the-doll",125
"STEWARDESS","There we go.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Ohh.. look at this..","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","What?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this (Gestures to Sally's present) stupid thing.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..","the-doll",125
"JERRY","No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Well, why don't you do your material?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I'm out.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Hey, buddies.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Like what?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) ""What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?""","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Confused) Where's the punchline?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)","the-doll",125
"GOERGE","(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..","the-doll",125
"JERRY","A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) ""The Costanzas""","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","So, what's your game? What do you like to play?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","Eight ball.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","You like to gamble, Cosmo?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..","the-doll",125
"FRANK","Five dollars a game, huh?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","I'll break.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","Okay.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","What's all this?","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Oh my God! What is that?!","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","(Rushing in) What? What is it?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","George, it's a doll.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","(Going back to the living room) Oh, get outta here..","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!","the-doll",125
"FRANK","We still haven't finished the first game.","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","The first game?!","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","What is this thing doing here?","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","Why?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","Oh, stop it.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Who else is on the show?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Uh.. one of the three tenors.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Extremely excited) The other guy?!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Why?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Why not?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Hey, you look awful.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Problem in the bedroom?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I thought you didn't want the doormat.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Who's Sally?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Susan's college roommate.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","That's sounds pretty juvenile.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!","the-doll",125
"FRANK","His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","Unfortunately those photographs are at home.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","A billiard room.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Confused) What?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","We call it.. the, uh..","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Snaps) The Place To Be!","the-doll",125
"FRANK","The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah?","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Really?","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","That's good thinking.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","You see?.. You see?!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Why don't you just get rid of it?","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","Hi, Elaine.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Did you see that?!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Through the intercom) It's Sally.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","A whole case.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Blunt, to the point) No.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","How come? I told you - It's fantastic.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Eh, I like mine.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","I don't want it.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Come in.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Peppy) Well, here I am!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. ""The Pride of Memphis!""","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","You could just do your material.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Peeved) I don't have any material!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!","the-doll",125
"DOLL","Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!","the-doll",125
"DOLL","You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)","the-doll",125
"WOMAN","(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Come on. Are you sure?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","I'd know him anywhere.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","I still say we're related.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Complaining) I can't make anything..","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","Follow through? What do you mean?","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..","the-doll",125
"FRANK","It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","Oh, my God!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Well, have you ever considered writing new material?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","What?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Hello?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Hi Jerry, it's Sally!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","No, but he should be home soon.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Is this for your comedy routine?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","(Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","(Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves)","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..","the-doll",125
"ELAINE AND JERRY","Hey!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Is George here?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?","the-doll",125
"CARRERAS","My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his ""That's a shame"" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled ""Ori-dent"") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","Well, I want to sit down.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","So?","the-doll",125
"JERRY","It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a ""Tada!"" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say ""I'll see ya."", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","(Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)","the-doll",125

"FRANK","(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?","the-doll",125
"FRANK","It's Carlo. I found him!","the-doll",125
"ESTELLE","(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)","the-doll",125
"KRAMER","(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!","the-doll",125
"JERRY","(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.","the-doll",125
"SALLY","Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)","the-doll",125

"MAESTRO","Elaine? What a surprise.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..","the-doll",125
"STAGEHAND","(Yelling from off-camera) Maestro, you're on!","the-doll",125
"MAESTRO","Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.","the-doll",125
"ELAINE","Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","I just wanted a second opinion.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)","the-doll",125
"DOLL","Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!","the-doll",125
"SUSAN","(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!","the-doll",125
"GEORGE","(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?","the-doll",125
"MAN","Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.","the-doll",125
"FRANK","(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)","the-doll",125
"THE END"," THE END","the-doll",125
"JERRY","The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, ""That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening.""","the-friars-club",126

"KRAMER","Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every","the-friars-club",126
"JERRY","Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.","the-friars-club",126
"KRAMER","Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.","the-friars-club",126
"JERRY","I didn't know you had a hopper.","the-friars-club",126
"KRAMER","(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.","the-friars-club",126

You know they're going in to battle, they think.. well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins.. and you got to make sure you have everything... lot more to worry about What if I get killed.? Is my wig on straight? I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men... but I know when it went out.! When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair on his head going ..All right! lets go rap to the ladies..","the-wig-master",127

"ELAINE","Ah! So he knew that you were making it up!","the-wig-master",127
"JERRY","Yeah..... He caught me. So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.","the-wig-master",127

"JERRY","I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed. (as concerned car owner) 'Can I see it?' (as doctor-like mechanic) 'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight.

"JERRY","Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"ELAINE","You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","I forgot.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"ELAINE","Oh, go down and get them.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","I can't. The car's at the mechanics.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"ELAINE","Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129

"TONY","I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"TONY","Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","I really wanna...","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"TONY","Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","How much money is this gonna cost me?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"TONY","(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're Talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","The washer fluid is fine.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"TONY","(angry) The washer fluid is not fine!","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"TONY","What d'you mean?","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129
"JERRY","Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.","the-bottle-deposit-part-1",129

"JERRY","They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"ELAINE","What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"ELAINE","What kind of maniac is this guy?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","He's a very special maniac.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"ELAINE","What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130

"PETERMAN","Snag?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"ELAINE","It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"PETERMAN","What does that have to do with my clubs?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"ELAINE","They happened to be in the back seat at the time.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"DETECTIVE","What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"DETECTIVE","All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment,","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","Had I been taking...?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"DETECTIVE","Well, did you leave the AC on? Do you zip over speed bumps?","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"JERRY","Not that I would think of doing such things.","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130

"JERRY","I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"GEORGE","Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130
"WILHELM","The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't","the-bottle-deposit-part-2",130

"ELAINE","Is that good?","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","It's better than Dondi.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Mm-hmm.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.","the-wait-out",131
"GEORGE","This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.","the-wait-out",131
"GEORGE","You have a car?","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Well, my friend, Alyse, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.","the-wait-out",131

"GEORGE","Really?","the-wait-out",131
"BETH","Mm-hm.","the-wait-out",131
"DAVID","Yeah.","the-wait-out",131

"JERRY","Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?","the-wait-out",131
"MICKEY","I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Really?","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)","the-wait-out",131
"MICKEY","Kramer's going to be my scene partner.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Kramer?","the-wait-out",131
"MICKEY","He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Ehh, I dunno..","the-wait-out",131
"KRAMER","Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks","the-wait-out",131
"MAN","Hey!","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","(Out of it) Huh?","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","So, now, what is our move? What do we do?","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","I don't know, but we don't have much time.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","(Agreeing) Mm.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Right.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..","the-wait-out",131
"JERRY","But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.","the-wait-out",131
"ELAINE","Then why are we calling?","the-wait-out",131

"GEORGE","...Huh!","the-invitations",132
"DOCTOR","Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?","the-invitations",132
"GEORGE","...Why?","the-invitations",132
"DOCTOR","We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.","the-invitations",132
"GEORGE","Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.","the-invitations",132
"DOCTOR","That's probably what did it.","the-invitations",132

"GEORGE","Boy, that was awkward!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","I don't mind the cemetery.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","What is that?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Star Trek II.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah...","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","So it's over?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Movie?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah, you in?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","George is going to the movies! (exits)","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","(pronouncing it ""kar-ah-tay"") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","...But with punching and kicking.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","What, she's been away?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","She's been in Mexico for six weeks.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","That was July 4th!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Oh, tons!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No, I don't.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","My what?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Jeannie... your fiancee.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Oh, yeah, that. Well...","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","All right. Spill it, Jerome.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","There's really not that much to tell.","the-foundation",133
"JEANNIE","See ya.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","See ya.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","You've never felt remorse.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","I know, I feel bad about that...","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","I bet your parents were upset, huh?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Eh.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","You haven't told them yet, have you?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No.","the-foundation",133
"DUGAN","""So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria...""","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is.","the-foundation",133
"DUGAN","It's a, uh, washcloth.","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","No washcloths!","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","(rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Mr. Peterman?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Pride?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Well, you're your own boss now.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I wanna go to a tractor pull.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Go ahead.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I am staying out all night!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Who's stopping you?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Whatever.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Oh God.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","What?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","It's Dolores.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Who?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Mulva.","the-foundation",133
"DOLORES","Jerry, hi.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Dolores!","the-foundation",133
"DOLORES","Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.","the-foundation",133
"DOLORES","Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","See ya.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Bye, Dolores.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I thought Mulva hated you.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","All the way?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Not our ""all the way"", their ""all the way."" I got the stink of responsibility on me.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","You stink worse than I do!","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!","the-foundation",133
"SECRETARY","Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","What? Well, who's gonna do it?","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","What about you?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Me? Why me?","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","Why, indeed.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Burma?","the-foundation",133
"J. PETERMAN","You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him)","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Mr. Peterman?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Where?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Burma.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Isn't it Myanmar now?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No, certainly not.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","I mean, I can't give people orders!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No one's gonna listen to you.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","I am not qualified to run the catalog!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","You're not qualified to work at the catalog.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Where?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Myanmar.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","The discount pharmacy?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Karate?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Katra?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, ""Yes, I can!""","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Sammy Davis had it.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","So I listened to my katra and now (vreep) I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Sure you have.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(excitedly) Okay.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","That kid is gonna be all right.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No, she's not.","the-foundation",133
"JOEY","Come on, Kramer!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Hey there.","the-foundation",133
"JOEY","Come on. Mom's down in the car.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Okay, Joey.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","You guys both have class at the same time?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","No, we're in the same class.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","What do you mean you're in the same class?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","He almost beat me.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Kramer, you're fighting children?!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","I got carpool. (exits)","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.","the-foundation",133
"JOEY","Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ZANFINO","Mmm, I don't know...","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ZANFINO","All right.","the-foundation",133
"DUGAN","*You're* taking the job?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!","the-foundation",133
"SENSEI","Are you prepared for kumite?","the-foundation",133
"SENSEI","Fight stance.","the-foundation",133
"SENSEI","Hydjama! Begin!","the-foundation",133
"SENSEI","(raising Kramer's arm) Winner!","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","It's open!","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(surprised) Rosses.","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ROSS","Hello, George.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ROSS","We know the last three months have been hard on you.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Oh, that's wonderful.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","You'll be on the board of directors.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ROSS","Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","I can't believe this is happening.","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, ""She's not really dead if her shadow is..."" Uh, w-what was it, dear?","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ROSS","Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?","the-foundation",133
"MR. ROSS","Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.","the-foundation",133
"MRS. ROSS","So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(feigning happiness) The second I see him.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Hey.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Hey. How's your day, good?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No, no, no, it's... ""She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.""","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Hey, board of directors. Look at you!","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Don't you see? I'm back in.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","All because of Wrath of Khan?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Yes!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Well, it was the best of those movies.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","KHAN!","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","George.","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","George. (taps him on the shoulder)","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(startled) Oh!","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Wink.","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","(correcting him) Wyck.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Wyck.","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Oh. I know they have some monies.","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Yes.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","And now?","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","This townhouse?","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","This would have been your wedding gift.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","And now?","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Not.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Not.","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","You know, it really can't.","the-foundation",133
"MULVA","So who broke it off?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.","the-foundation",133
"MULVA","Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","I am. It was the world's first.","the-foundation",133
"MULVA","You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","(answering) Hello?","the-foundation",133
"SECRETARY","Please hold for Elaine Benes.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Oh, I don't believe this.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(picking up) Jerry!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Hey!","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","How's it look?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Huh?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","I say, it's a peach.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","I gotta do some research here.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Oh, I'm the doofus?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah, that's what I was thinking.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Kramer!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Oh, hey.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","What are you doing?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","You never said you were fighting children.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Search... for Spock?!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(pushes him) You doofus!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.","the-foundation",133
"RUTHIE","Same.","the-foundation",133
"WILLIE","Are we about through here?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.","the-foundation",133
"JOEY","She had a little change of plans.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?","the-foundation",133
"GIRL","Now we finish it.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Aah! Aah! Mama!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","So... did you stop by the dojo?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Yep.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","How's your confidence level?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Shot.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Self-esteem?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Gone.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Doofus?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(raises her hand) Yo.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","What is that?","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Well, nobody sees the... cover.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","God!","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","What happened to you?","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","Well, then I was way off!","the-foundation",133
"ELAINE","Well, I'll see ya... (exits)","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Vaya con dios.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","No, he's still stuck at the foundation.","the-foundation",133
"KRAMER","You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Would I have had access to that?","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Of course, it would have been yours.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","And now?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(anticipating the answer) Not.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Hello?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","My story?","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","(chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","(remorsefully) I can't go.","the-foundation",133
"JERRY","What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!","the-foundation",133
"WYCK","Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?","the-foundation",133
"THE END"," THE END","the-foundation",133
"GEORGE","You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Pardon?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","(mutters it again)","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","He cleared his throat?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yes!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","So?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","He did it right as he said ""her unfortunate accident.""","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Not getting it.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Oh, help me, Rhonda.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","What time is it?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","1:15.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Right now?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I gotta go meet Pam.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Where's Elaine?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","What's with all these people having babies?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Perpetuation of the species.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yeah! Right!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","By the way, just for the record -","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)","the-soul-mate",134
"CAROL","...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Well, that's...that's sweet.","the-soul-mate",134
"GAIL","Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.","the-soul-mate",134
"CAROL","Elaine, you gotta have a baby!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...","the-soul-mate",134
"LISA","Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","I really like the city.","the-soul-mate",134
"CAROL","The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Uh, it was in the Hamptons.","the-soul-mate",134
"CAROL","Oh! I have pictures!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","No, no, that's okay, it's uh...","the-soul-mate",134
"CAROL","Look at him! Just look at him!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Jerry Lewis?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","That's pretty paranoid.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Yes, it is.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I like it!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I thought you might.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Hi, sorry I'm late.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","That's okay. Kramer let me in.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Go on.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Ah, yes. Forbidden love.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","""Pam."" I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","She has delicate beauty.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","And yet, he's my friend.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I thought we were talking about me.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Confront Jerry? I can't.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","You must!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I won't!","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","You will!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","""Elaine, ya gotta have a baby."" Ugh.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Where are all the poetry magazines?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","The New Yorker has poetry.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yes. The New Yorker.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","C'mon, you want to have a baby.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Why? Because I can?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, I'm sorry.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yeah, like you must procreate.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Besides, anyone can do it.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Are you okay, George?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Not at all.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh. Are you alright?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Yeah, I'll be okay.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, no...that won't last.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","What do you mean?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","He's not ga-ga.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","How long did you leave it up there?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Five minutes. What the hell happened here?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Is that it?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Stopped dead.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","What do you make of it?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Jerry. Uh, can we talk?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Kinda busy here.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Why can't I stay?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Because it doesn't concern you.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","So, what's on your mind?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","It's Pam.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Pam? What about Pam?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I love her, Jerry!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","You what?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I love her!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Is that right?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","What does that mean?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, and that voice!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","What about her name?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","She's got really nice hair.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","You've got really specific tastes.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","She's got nice calves.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","No you can't, Jerry.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","But I might.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Oh, no you don't.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","What...?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Huh?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Pam!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Huh?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Pam!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","So now he wants her more than ever!","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Blast!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","What am I gonna do, huh?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","What, again with you?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","If only I could say things like that around her.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Yes...","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","It's baffling, isn't it?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Ga-ga? When did that happen?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Yesterday. Six-ish.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","You just met the guy yesterday.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yeah, but we have a common goal.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yeah, of course.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, ""Pardon my French.""","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh, hi! Kramer.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Hi. How are you?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Hi. How are you?","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","I'm great.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","I too am well.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I too am well.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Do I smell Pantene?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Do I smell?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Pantene!","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Uh, Pantene.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","What?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","That's so true.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Shell.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Kramer, that is so lovely.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh, what's his name?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Elaine, you've changed my life.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","I got a vasectomy this morning.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Although, I have a hunch you mean it.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Kramer!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Hello, Newman.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Why not?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","C'mon. (They exit.)","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I can't believe I'm losing Pam!","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I thought we were talking about me.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Right.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane ""observations""?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","Well, there is a little something you can do for me...","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","C'mon, out with it.","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","It's about...Elaine.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","What was that?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","This is! Oh boy, I always do this.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","What?","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Really?","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Yeah!","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Yeah!","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 114th scale.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","When did you build this thing?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Wait, that's you?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","I really think the M&M should be you.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","And?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Okay. That's what we know.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","But we already knew that.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Well, yeah.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I don't know if you're ready for it.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Please.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?","the-soul-mate",134
"VOICE ON SPEAKER","It's Pam.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","What was that?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","We were just playin.'","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Uh huh...","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","This is the man you have a crush on?","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Well, I have feelings for both of you.","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","Why can't I be a soul mate?","the-soul-mate",134
"KRAMER","Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?","the-soul-mate",134
"PAM","Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","George...","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","What are you guys doing here?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","We're getting vasectomies.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Why?","the-soul-mate",134
"NEWMAN","I'm doing it for you.","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","What?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","What'd you do to your hair?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","I cut it.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","It's a little short.","the-soul-mate",134
"KEVIN","Y'think?","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","What are you doing here?","the-soul-mate",134
"ELAINE","Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY AND NEWMAN","Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Is that a Keats poem?","the-soul-mate",134
"GEORGE","No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?","the-soul-mate",134
"MR. CROSS","Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.","the-soul-mate",134
"MS. BAINES","Of course he killed her.","the-soul-mate",134
"WYCK","So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.","the-soul-mate",134
"THE END"," THE END","the-soul-mate",134
"JERRY","All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Fine.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(resigned) At least it's show business..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","What if she's got no interest in you?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(frustrated) Wha??","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(dry) He knows.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","You sure?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(dry) He knows.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Wow.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Why don't you try your engagement story?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Are you sure?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(wry) He knows.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","Friends?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"MAN","(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"MAN","Come on, let's go.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Not bad. Wuh--what does she--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(dry) I put her stats on the back.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Pretty impressive--""Serious boyfriend '92 to '95."" Owns her own car.. ""Favorite president: James Polk!"" (ELAINE had","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Hnn! Let me see that.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Why would anybody want a friend.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(dread) Uh.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","I mean all that stuff is so small..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","What?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(getting up) Can I keep this?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","No, I need it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(absently leaving with it) Thanks.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"AMANDA","I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"AMANDA","Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"AMANDA","Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","(shaking hands) I'm George.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Jerry?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Gillian. Hiii..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Very nice to meet you.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","It's nice to meet you!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","She had man-hands.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(pause) Man, Hands?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(weary) {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Would she have hooks?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Kinda cool lookin'..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(weary) Jerry!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Kramer?!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Hey buddy! Hey!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Breakfast. I gotta be in at BrandLeland by nine.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Why??","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Because I'm workin' there, that's why.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at BrandLeland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","How much are they payin' you?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER"," KRAMER","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"T.C.B.","You know, takin' care o' business.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","All right.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","W-w-wha' you got in there?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(as he leaves with it) Crackers.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","So the picture worked. Amazing!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Hey, she wants me to dress uh ""smart casual."" What uh, what is that?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","I don't know, but you don't have it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Right. Bye.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Where were you today?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","What?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Pick. Up.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(whispers) Damn.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","So? Where were you?!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","So? What are friends for?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","So he's Bizarro Jerry!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(pause) Bizarro Jerry?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(pause) Shouldn't he say ""Bad bye""? Isn't that the, opposite of ""Good bye""?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","No. It's still a goodbye.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Uh. Does he live underwater?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","No.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Is he black..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Wow. Man. What a day.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Tough day at the office?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine,","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"AMANDA","These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"AMANDA","So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Would you like some bread, Jerry?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Well, then at least drink your beer.. (she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(to self) Oh. Twist off..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","You have a little something on your face.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","I can get it. (feeling his face)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. (reaches over)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","(friendly) It's an eyelash. Make a wish.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","I don't want to.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","Make a wish.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GILLIAN","(smiles at him) Don't you just love lobster?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","I know, he's so tiny!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call","the-bizarro-jerry",135

"JERRY","Then it does exist.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Yes. The legends are true.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","So when are you goin' out with this girl again?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","I'm not! I'm inside the walls!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","So you're gonna burn that bridge.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GEORGE","Flame on!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GENE","(about the check) I got it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","(grabs it) No. You got it last time.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"GENE","(calmly takes it) Don't worry about it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","(to self in head) This is unbelievable..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"FELDMAN","Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"FELDMAN","Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KEVIN","(getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","What are you gonna do down there?","the-bizarro-jerry",135

"JERRY","So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Uh-huh.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, {steer}.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Yeah..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","That's nice..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Oh here we go--","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","(pause) It's your third day..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","Well.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"ELAINE","What? What is goin' on with you two?","the-bizarro-jerry",135

"KRAMER","{Ow!} It's my stomach.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"JERRY","You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.","the-bizarro-jerry",135

"LELAND","No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"LELAND","Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","I don't even really work here!","the-bizarro-jerry",135

"KEVIN","(eyes closed in hug) Oh.","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"THE END"," THE END","the-bizarro-jerry",135
"KRAMER","I wouldn't walk over there.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Why not?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips,","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","You were livin' in the village then, right?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Don't really remember.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","That is disgusting.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Well, then you're drivin' me wild.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Like with dogs.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Exactly.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Party?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Food?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Uh huh.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Bar?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","George?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","He's gonna show up anyway.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","George, I just don't want you interfering.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","How could I possibly interfere?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know,","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","No thanks.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","My name is George.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves)","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","So...","the-little-kicks",136
"MAN","How 'bout leading us in a toast?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Sweet Fancy Moses!","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","You get the tickets?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are,","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah I guess I do owe you.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, I'm okay.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","There's no problem, really.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Food was good.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","So I didn't miss anything?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Elaine danced?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","What, you mean you know about this?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","And by then you've lost interest.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68","the-little-kicks",136
"GTO."," GTO.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What made him get that thing?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Brody's in.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I don't even have the extra ticket yet.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Well, you better get on the horn.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","How could that be?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, George was there, he said he had a great time.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Oh, what are you talkin' about?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Now you're talkin' crazy!","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","You have a minute to approve some copy?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the party last night?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","It was a real... kick.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","As a matter of fact I did.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Why? He seems harmless.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh he's not. He's very harmful.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Really?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","And you two are friends?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Yeah, we're good friends.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","So this Anna called me from out of the blue.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Really? I thought you were rebuffed.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","With extreme prejudice.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Yes, yes...","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","The bad fianc, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Okay, the point is made.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Half of show business is here.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","There's Brody. Brody! Over here.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","It's for all of us. Is there a problem?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I'm a joke maker.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Relax, he does that all the time.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Does what?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, huh?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","May I see you outside for a moment please?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","But I want to--","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Outside!","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Hey, have you seen Anna?","the-little-kicks",136
"WORKER","Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?","the-little-kicks",136
"WORKER","The park, why?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","It's not legitimate.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","It's a business.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Where did you meet this guy?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer. (boom sound)","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I don't believe this. (They run into theater)","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","No... a little. Nice car.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Yeah, she's a sweet ride.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Is that your orthopedic back pillow?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Maybe.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Well is it or isn't it?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Guess not.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","(To George) Stay away from her.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I didn't do nothin'.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","(To Anna) Get in the car.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","But...","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Lighten up.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Uh, I got a cramp.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Hey, what is going on over there?","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry, if the man is in pain...","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","All right, I'm takin' the camera.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Oh man...","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","How was the rest of Death Blow?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","He's quite a character, isn't he?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","I got it. Yep.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Brody.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Come on up. It's Brody.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What if I didn't do it right?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","It's your first time. He'll understand.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Hey, Brody!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Hi.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","I've never seen such beautiful work. You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Well, I did the best I could.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","May I use your phone?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Uh yeah. It's under the couch.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Look at you! You've got another gig!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","We're talkin' federal crime here.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat)","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Sure, do you need a glove?","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Nah.","the-little-kicks",136
"WORKER","I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","What?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Sorry, I got hung up.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","At Yankee Stadium?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","This? It's mine.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","He's not stocky.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Who did that? Who did that?!?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","(laughing) The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","That's fine.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Do you even know what this scene is about?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Wha? Where?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Nah, he's not going to know the difference.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot)","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Right here. (Elaine enters)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","(He shows her) This umpf thing.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","It's dancing.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I dance fine.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","You stink. (He exits)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Jerry, do I stink?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","All right, you're beyond stink.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","But I really enjoy dancing.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","It's that bad?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.","the-little-kicks",136
"VOICE","I have George Costanza still holding.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Yo, Anna.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Hi, George. What're you up to?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","(Ironing) You don't wanna know.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","What're you talkin' about?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I never should have given Anna the impression--","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Pick it up, pick it up!","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","What?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","You are ruinin' everything.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Um, no, I don't think so.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I'm a bad man!","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","So where's the tape?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","I need the tape.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Are you out of your mind?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer...","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh,","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","All right. That's it, I can't work like this.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry...","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I'm off the project. (He exits)","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry!","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","I want the tape.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Did you say dangerous?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I'm a bootlegger.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","You're a what?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Isn't that illegal?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","I can do hard time for this one. And community service!","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Is this your FiberCon?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry, George got arrested.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Yeah. He went at the Beekman, he tried to land, but they cheesed him.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Brody, I'm comin' up.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","What're we gonna do?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Where's the tape?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Uh, well. It, uh...","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","Is that it?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.","the-little-kicks",136
"BRODY","How'd it turn out?","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.","the-little-kicks",136
"KRAMER","Yeah, it's a disturbing image.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry again.","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","(George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Anna...","the-little-kicks",136
"ANNA","Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","Okay, where's my boy?","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Oh my God.","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)","the-little-kicks",136
"GEORGE","Ow! Dad...","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","Who put you up to this, was it her?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","You got that right.","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","What the hell does that mean?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","You sayin' you want a piece of me?","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","I could drop you like a bag of dirt.","the-little-kicks",136
"FRANK","You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","But he's an old man, Elaine.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","No you don't.","the-little-kicks",136
"MAN","You shot Death Blow?","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-little-kicks",136
"MAN","That was brilliant.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","Thank you. (They continue walking)","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","You were big.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the","the-little-kicks",136
"ELAINE","Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.","the-little-kicks",136
"JERRY","I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)","the-little-kicks",136

"ELAINE","Well it's , it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know they're made of paper.","the-package",137
"DOCTOR","Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...","the-package",137

"JERRY","They have gotten to know you.","the-package",137
"ELAINE","Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my","the-package",137
"GEORGE","Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.","the-package",137
"ELAINE","Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.","the-package",137

"JERRY","I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","No more mentor?","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Looks that way.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Well at least you and I are okay again.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Why?","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","I can tell you what to do.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","No, it's more than that.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","I can tell you what to think.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","I need someone I can trust.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Oh.","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Kind of in the middle of something here, George.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","George?","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","I gotta run anyway.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Yeah, see ya.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","What's your problem.","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","No problem.","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","Well, I'm not married to it.","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","Dewy meadow.","the-fatigues",138
"ESTELLE","Here's your omelet.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","It's dry.","the-fatigues",138
"ESTELLE","That's the way I always make it.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Well it sucks.","the-fatigues",138
"ESTELLE","What did you say?","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your","the-fatigues",138
"ESTELLE","Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Alright.","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","Okay.","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Hey Jerry.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Oh, hey Banya.","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Oh, that's too bad.","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","You think you can give me a hand with my material?","the-fatigues",138
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","You still need a cook?","the-fatigues",138
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Ya got T-Fal?","the-fatigues",138
"KRAMER","Keflon.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","No! Follow me.","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","George Costanza is your mentor?","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Who?","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","A Mister Kenneth Banya.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Banya?","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.","the-fatigues",138
"ABBY","Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","Cool.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","I don't want to talk about it.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Come on, don't be a baby.","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","That's it?","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Mm. This food is fantastic.","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Have you tried the hamentashen?","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","I can't get off the kishkas.","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Hey Jerry!","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Banya?","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Risk management?","the-fatigues",138
"BANYA","Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even","the-fatigues",138
"WOMAN","So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","That's right.","the-fatigues",138
"WOMAN","How much are they paying you? I'll double it.","the-fatigues",138
"KRAMER","Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Where's the powdered sugar?","the-fatigues",138
"KRAMER","You know Frank, you could take a break.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","You're quitting?","the-fatigues",138
"EDDIE","I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.","the-fatigues",138
"ELAINE","Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!","the-fatigues",138
"VOICE","Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?","the-fatigues",138
"GEORGE","They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.","the-fatigues",138
"WILHELM","He's my protg.","the-fatigues",138
"FRANK","Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!","the-fatigues",138
"THE END"," THE END","the-fatigues",138
"JERRY","Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","What is this, a 'bit'?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","No.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","'Cos I'm not in the mood.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(thinking) Great. Thanks.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","You know Farbman?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Mm, love Farbman.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Brett? Don't you think that would be great?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Brett?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(still staring off) After the song, babe.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","The song.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","So when do I meet this jerk?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Who?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous,","the-checks",139
"JERRY","What song?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Desperado.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Desperado?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Uh huh.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Uh huh.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I invented that.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","That, had to be invented?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Elaine.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history","the-checks",139
"CLICKY","Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(looking at Jerry) Ohh.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.","the-checks",139
"CLICKY","Yeah, that's where he come up with it.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","In his dreams.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the","the-checks",139
"JERRY","It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","What checks?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","Look at all of those! You're rich!","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Why?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Ah, who are any of her losers?","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(dryly) You're on that list.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?","the-checks",139
"EGO","Yeah, you heard of 'em?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Signed over a hundred checks this morning.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Hello, twelve dollars.","the-checks",139
"MR OH","Excuse me. Would you take picture please?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I'm gonna ask this guy something.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.","the-checks",139
"MR YAMAGUCHI","Hai.","the-checks",139
"MR OH","Yes.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super","the-checks",139
"MR OH","Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.","the-checks",139
"MR OH","What is he doing?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.","the-checks",139
"MR OH","He's funny.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","(calling to George) We're pretty much finished.","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","There's just one more thing.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","(clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","(flat) No.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(let down) So, that's it?","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","Unless you need a receipt.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing.","the-checks",139
"CREW LEADER","(flat) Good luck with that.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Hey.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","What's with the claw?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Hi.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Ah, I'm one kind.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","The Fleckman.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Farbman.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Right.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","No. I'm fine, thank you.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Don't worry. It's no charge to you.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(quiet) Oops.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You","the-checks",139
"JERRY","You look like you could use a...","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(warning) Jerry.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run","the-checks",139
"MR OH","(thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.","the-checks",139
"BRETT","I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Why? Why d'you think he's upset?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","(smiling) I hope not.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Elaine, the song.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought","the-checks",139
"BRETT","Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","No spiel?","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call","the-checks",139
"JERRY","So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","They could've at least tried!","the-checks",139
"JERRY","You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","Please.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Too dumb?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","That's right.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","How'd you hook up with these guys?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See","the-checks",139
"JERRY","What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(excited) Yeah, the pilot!","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in","the-checks",139
"TV JERRY","You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go","the-checks",139
"TV ELAINE","Well, why do I need your permission?","the-checks",139
"TV JERRY","Because he's my butler.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(eager) So? What d'you think?","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car","the-checks",139
"JERRY","No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.","the-checks",139
"GEORGE","(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm","the-checks",139
"JERRY","You know, what you need is a song you can share.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","(points) I like Witchy Woman.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Witchy Woman?","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(to Jerry) Hey, man.","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Ah.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?","the-checks",139
"JERRY","What for?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.","the-checks",139
"JERRY","I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you","the-checks",139
"JERRY","Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of","the-checks",139
"ELAINE","In them?!","the-checks",139
"JERRY","You have them sleeping in drawers?!","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in","the-checks",139
"JERRY","This has 'international incident' written all over it.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.","the-checks",139
"MR TANAKA","Goodnight.","the-checks",139
"KRAMER","Goodnight, Mr Oh.","the-checks",139
"MR OH","(sits up) Goodnight.","the-checks",139

"HEATHER","Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean,","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","Well that makes sense.","the-chicken-roaster",140

"HEATHER","Be my guest.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","Good to see you again.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere.","the-chicken-roaster",140

"GEORGE","Oh, I don't know. Check this out.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","You stole her clock?","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","Well done.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","Yep, this one for our side!","the-chicken-roaster",140
"JERRY","What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"JERRY","Hello, is somebody there? Mr. Marbles?","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I","the-chicken-roaster",140
"KRAMER","You should sleep with him.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"JERRY","Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's","the-chicken-roaster",140

"JERRY","You know my friend Bob Sacamano?","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","I thought he was Kramer's friend.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"JERRY","Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, he sells","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","fourty bucks? Are they Sable?","the-chicken-roaster",140

"KRAMER","That was a close one.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"NEWMAN","Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?","the-chicken-roaster",140

"IPSWITCH","Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","Well, that's a kind of sable.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"IPSWITCH","No, its a kind of rat.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","That's a rat hat?","the-chicken-roaster",140
"IPSWITCH","And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice","the-chicken-roaster",140
"ELAINE","But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"IPSWITCH","Yes, and quite mad from what I hear.","the-chicken-roaster",140

"KRAMER","No, but this is all very exciting.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my hat, I think","the-chicken-roaster",140
"KRAMER","Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right out of your","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","I've looked at that, seems unlikely.","the-chicken-roaster",140
"KRAMER","I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?","the-chicken-roaster",140
"GEORGE","I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into that","the-chicken-roaster",140
"KRAMER","That's a shame.","the-chicken-roaster",140

"GEORGE","Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Why are we flyin' over the Andes?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Kramer.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","So fast? What about me?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","No.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Well I would eat you.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","That's very nice, I guess.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Thank you.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Can I have a piece of that?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","No.","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","George, I can't have sex.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","With me or in general?","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","I went to the doctor today. I have mono.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Nucleosis.","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.","the-abstinence",141

"GEORGE","Yeah, six weeks.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","What guys?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Like us. (Elaine enters)","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","So it's just mono.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","No something is bunk and then you debunk it.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","What?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I think. (Pause as they all look down)","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)","the-abstinence",141

"KATIE","You're the-- (He hangs up)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","They asked you to do career day?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Yeah, it's no big deal.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","And you were integral.","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I'm on next, right?","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","The guy with the lizard.","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","So can you come back tomorrow?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","When do you take this exam?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Well, um...","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Well, can I introduce you as doctor?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Yeah.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","All right, that's all I wanted to know.","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","Mono. (George removes hand)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","So you're enjoying the not enjoying.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Hey, buddy. How was career day?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","You got bumped from career day?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","It was a mix-up, I'm sure.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","They're trying to screw with your head.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)","the-abstinence",141
"LARRY","Take it outside.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Come on, Larry. You know me.","the-abstinence",141
"LARRY","It bothers people, and it's against the law.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","What, did they kick you out too?","the-abstinence",141
"MAN","Yeah, they kicked us all out.","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","But I was promised this slot.","the-abstinence",141
"TEACHER","Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line)","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Fire drill, can you believe that?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","What is Pericles?","the-abstinence",141
"ALEX TREBEK","Pericles is correct.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Hey, you got any matches?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Middle drawer.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?","the-abstinence",141

"KATIE","Jerry.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Oh hi, Katie.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","What is Borax?","the-abstinence",141
"ALEX TREBEK","Yes, you're right.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Ashtrays?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","No, I don't have any ashtrays.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Ooh, cereal bowls.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","What is Tungsten or Wolfram?","the-abstinence",141
"ALEX TREBEK","We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Is this a repeat?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","You think?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Need some more matches.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","What is goin' on in there?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Why?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","It doesn't?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","why not?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","All right.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man)","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Oh my God.","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","What's wrong?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)","the-abstinence",141

"BEN","Well, I'm an intern.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.","the-abstinence",141
"WOMAN","Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Well, there's a doctor right here.","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","No there's not.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Can't you at least tell him what to do?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Like what?","the-abstinence",141
"SUE ELLEN","Shouldn't he elevate his legs?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Right. Elevate your legs!","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.","the-abstinence",141
"LARRY","I thought he was a doctor.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Of course. Absolute zero!","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","What? What is with all these books?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I stopped having sex.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I was out.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","An assembly?","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Superfreak?","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Yes.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","What is your answer to number 74?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Medobolic acidosis.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.","the-abstinence",141
"JETER","Now who are you again?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.","the-abstinence",141
"WILLIAMS","Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?","the-abstinence",141
"JETER","We won the World Series.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","In six games.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Nine minutes.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","How am I gonna fill two hours?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)","the-abstinence",141
"WAITRESS","More coffee?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?","the-abstinence",141
"WAITRESS","Si","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.","the-abstinence",141
"WAITRESS","Mute pragalas senor","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Eh, don't mention it.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Portuguese?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Are you all right?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","What? What are you talking about?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","I don't understand.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Exactly.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Hey buddy.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Hey.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","What?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Look away, I'm hideous.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.","the-abstinence",141
"B","Pooh!","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Pooh...(laughing)","the-abstinence",141
"B","No, it's Winnie the Pooh.","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","So what did you do?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I told her I would have to think about it.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Simple joke from a simple man.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","So you're never gonna have sex again?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","Oh no.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Jackie we gotta talk.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","But Jackie--","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","I said out.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","The who?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","The tobacco companies.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","I've been wanting a piece of them for years.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","No, it didn't say anything.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","Your face is my case.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","How ya doin'?","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Not good. I'm a moron.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","What for? Oh come on.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","I think it has something to do with me.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","George, I have to have sex.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.","the-abstinence",141
"LOUISE","Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)","the-abstinence",141
"WAITRESS","Mas Caf?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Si, por favor.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Who could love me?","the-abstinence",141
"WILKIE","I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.","the-abstinence",141
"WILKIE","All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Congratulations! You passed!","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?","the-abstinence",141
"BEN","I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.","the-abstinence",141
"ELAINE","Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Where have you been? You know, you're on next.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I got lost on the way over.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Got lost? We went to school here for three years.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","No, the Portuguese waitress.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","The Portuguese waitress?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","George, George, you're on.","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","No, no. I'm not going on.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Then what'd you come down here for?","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","It's good to have you back.","the-abstinence",141
"KATIE","One of you has to go on.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","She made an offer. I took it.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","How much?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","No, no, no. There was no money.","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","No money? Then what'd we get?","the-abstinence",141
"KRAMER","Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)","the-abstinence",141
"JACKIE","This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.","the-abstinence",141
"LETTERMAN","Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?","the-abstinence",141
"LETTERMAN","those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?","the-abstinence",141
"JERRY","Jerry.","the-abstinence",141
"LETTERMAN","Right. Jerry.","the-abstinence",141
"THE END"," THE END","the-abstinence",141
"GEORGE","Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Gets up) Get out!","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Definite) Oh yeah.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","You know what? It's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","She's out.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Disgusted) What is with that?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","Excuse me, George?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","(Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball) toward Mrs. Ricadi. She backs off defensively) Come on! (Stops and laughs right before running into her)","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving).","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","(Correcting) Shipwreck.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","I remember.. (Leaves)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) ""Cancer in labratory animals""..","the-andrea-doria",142
"WAITER","Excuse me, Elaine Benes?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Yeah?","the-andrea-doria",142
"WAITER","An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Shocked) Stabbed?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"WAITER","More bread?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Did you find out who stabbed him?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY AND ELAINE","Hey.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hey. How's the new place?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELIANE","I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","How do you know?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales of the Sea"" 51 people died.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","51 people?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","There were 1,650 survivors.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Oh yeah. I also got ""Astounding Bear Attacks""","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Newman?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Sometimes we don't get what we want.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Confused) What are you talking about?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","I didn't get my transfer.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","""Transfer""?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You quit the post office?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?","the-andrea-doria",142
"MAN","What cough?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Just.. one of those things, you know.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","I don't know. Could be.","the-andrea-doria",142
"CAROL","Alan?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Carol?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","(Between screams) No, that was a different girl.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Mmm.. Bad how?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Agreeing) What's more important?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Between coughs) Hey.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","What's with the dog?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Oh..","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","A vet?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELDRIDGE","Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELDRIDGE","(Defensively) We had to abandon ship.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Well, all vacations have to end eventually.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELDRIDGE","The boat sank.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So,","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELDRIDGE","Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. (Enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him)","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!","the-andrea-doria",142
"VET","What are the symptoms?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's","the-andrea-doria",142
"VET","Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","(Fast) Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head. (Gets up to leave)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Pardon?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","You got a big head. It's too big for your body. (Walks for the door)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the ""Astonishing Tales of Costanza"".","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Interested) I should!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You're the man!","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Jerry!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Angered) Hello.. Newman.","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","What's the difference?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You're giving up that easy?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","(Intrigued) What are you proposing?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","An alliance?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me ""big head"".","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","""Big head"" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hello?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(On the other line) Hey.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hey, George.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You can't make it?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Alright. (Hangs up)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Gives a ""That's a shame"" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","I don't want to!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","C'mon. Just sit down!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Squirming) Jerry! What?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Sit down! Sit down!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","(Struggling) Hey!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! ""For Smuckers""? ""May cause panting and loss of fur""? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Whe have the same symptoms.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","No, no. No doctors.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","Where are you going?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","I don't know..","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!","the-andrea-doria",142
"DRIVER","Lady, could you move your head a little bit?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","What?","the-andrea-doria",142
"DRIVER","Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..","the-andrea-doria",142
"ESTELLE","I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","Get outta here! We have a booth.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ESTELLE","Frank, I'm cold!","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","Order a hot dish.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ESTELLE","Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","(Yelling) That's not a booth!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ESTELLE","(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ESTELLE","(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.","the-andrea-doria",142
"FRANK","(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","No, Jerry!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)","the-andrea-doria",142
"KRAMER","No! Don't!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELDRIDGE","Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the","the-andrea-doria",142
"RICARDI","(Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Kramer bit me!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Bit you?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route -","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Well, why not?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","What am I gonna wear?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!","the-andrea-doria",142
"OWNER","Mail on Sunday?","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, ""Photographs - Do not bend"".","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","""Do not bend"". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand..","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","What?","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","How did they know?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Pleading) I tried my best!","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","You know, this is your coat.","the-andrea-doria",142
"NEWMAN","(Realizing) Damn!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","They're making their decision today.","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","What's the matter with you?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","What giant freak-head?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Getting up to leave) Alright.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","I want to apologize for..","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","So you have a big head.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Casually playing along) So what?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","It goes well with that bump in your nose.","the-andrea-doria",142
"ELAINE","(Suddenly angry) What?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"WOMAN","Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police ""The Old Mill Restaurant"". Hurry!","the-andrea-doria",142
"COP","Boy, that's some cough you got there.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands)","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Yeah.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Oh, fork in the forehead.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","That's why they gave you the apartment?","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.","the-andrea-doria",142
"GEORGE","Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!","the-andrea-doria",142
"ALAN","Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George)","the-andrea-doria",142
"THE END"," THE END","the-andrea-doria",142
"JERRY","So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Five minutes.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Five minutes? That's it?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","What's the difference? You never showed up.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Well, we barely knew the guy.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","That's the way it works.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","When did you tell George to be here?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","About five.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","How did you know about that?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","He can't do that.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Fantastic day! Fantastic!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","What happened?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Fantastic.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Then, I'm at The Foundation...","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","You're still doing that?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Sometimes, once in a while.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","When you feel guilty.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","That's caged heat.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yeah-hah!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","What are you gonna do there?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, maybe take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Yes, I know, I know.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","I noticed you chose the ""clowns with balloons"" check design.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. (Kramer gets up to leave by climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor, then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked in his collar.)","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","I gotta call the office. Honey, would you order for me?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","I'm a ""honey."" He's pretty great, huh?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Is he from the future?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","What? Clinging to some scraps?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains of a once great society of hair.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","People seem to like the clowns.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","'Kay.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Aren't you going to take the check down?","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Sorry, no. It's store policy.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","But it's your bodega.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Even I am not above the policy.","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","Those are our tennis courts.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","No.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","This prison stinks.","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","Nice to meet you.","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","I'll be in my office if you need me.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Thanks, Warden.","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","Betsy.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Betsy.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","So, are you the head of the foundation?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So uh, you two shop at the same store?","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","No, it's standard issue.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Oh my God...you're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","You asked her out?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Well...not ""out."" She's in prison.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","How could you ask her out?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","That was different!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I'll say.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","The pop-in.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really well...","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Conjugal visit?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Don't jinx it!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Hey. What's up?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","George is dating a convict.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Oh? What's she in for?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Embezzlement.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, not here. (Goes into the hallway, comes back in with a huge bag of chicken feed.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I sense something is afoot.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Yeah, I bought a chicken.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Allow me. Why?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Allow me. What are you, an idiot?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch. (Tosses his wallet to Elaine, she pays the delivery guy.)","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Hey, driver's licence. Oh...my God.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","What?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Oh, Jerry loves the morning.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Who?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not a chicken.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Of course it is. I picked it out myself.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Well, you picked out a rooster.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","This was fun.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yeah. I had a great time.","the-little-jerry",143
"GUARD","Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","The whole hour just flew by. (Begins cleaning up the table.)","the-little-jerry",143
"GUARD","I'll get that.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Of course you will. You're the best.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Hello?","the-little-jerry",143
"HELEN","Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I'm not having money problems.","the-little-jerry",143
"HELEN","Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.","the-little-jerry",143
"MORTY","He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! (George enters.)","the-little-jerry",143
"HELEN","That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!","the-little-jerry",143
"HELEN","We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!","the-little-jerry",143
"MORTY","I don't see envelopes!","the-little-jerry",143
"HELEN","They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Ma! Ma! MA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.)","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","How're the folks?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Good.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","So? Movie tonight?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I thought you were going out with Celia.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Having her in jail.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.) Take a look at that.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. (George overhears and stands up, concerned.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","So he just shaves his head for no reason?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","It's just hair.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","It's not just hair! Look! (Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","It's brown.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","It's chestnut with auburn highlights!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","So?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is. (They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and struggling to keep his composure.) I'm sorry, George, but it's true.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","I knew it.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs)","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Sorry Kramer, can't help you.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","I like the way he handles himself.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","What?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.)","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head for?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","About three years.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Huh.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) I'm going bald!","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","George! I'm so glad to see you!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","Good news - I'm up for parole.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","So Marcelino's going to take down the check?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Great! (realizing) What?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Ah ha...","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Only in The United States.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","It's inhumane!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","It's two roosters peckin' at each other!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","What?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Yeah!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like ""American Gladiators.""","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, I left him with Marcelino!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, he's more than O.K., he won!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","You let him fight?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","How long do they usually last?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Great!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Celia's up for parole.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","What?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Who?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I'm too tired.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Alright. (Kramer leaves.)","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Ah, I'm so sorry.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","In other words, a normal relationship.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Well, she'll still be an ex-con.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","It's not the same.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","I don't care.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","You already ate?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","It's from yesterday.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Now we have a new deal.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","New deal?","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","This is outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","85 cents.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","85 cents? That is outrageous!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, that's out of the question.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","You know, I think you're jealous.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Of what?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer, give me that rooster!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very...crafty.","the-little-jerry",143
"BETSY","Does she have any plans after she's released?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them, you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer won't sell.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Well, thank you, Marcelino.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","You want Little Jerry to take a dive?","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Shhh, not so loud.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Can, too!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.","the-little-jerry",143
"MARCELINO","Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","O.K.!","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Oh, God.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Happy? Why should I be happy?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Who will I be?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","How long do I have?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","14 months. Maybe 10.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Is there anything I can do?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Celia? What are you doing here?","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","And you just decided to pop in...!","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Kurt!","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me? (Elaine is shocked.)","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Hey, Kramer...?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Be careful. (George enters.) Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Is that good?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","I don't know. Where have you been?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Oh my God! The break-outpop-in!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" time...","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Plus, you want to get to know me.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Yeah, yeah, that too.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Well, how much time?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","I don't know...a year?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","No, no, no...it has to be now.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Could I see the ring again?","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","So, you're actually considering it?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to? (George comes over.)","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Hey, sorry I'm late.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Where's Celia?","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. (Kramer comes over with Little Jerry.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Hey, how's he doin'?","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Look at the size of his bird!","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Ah, damn.","the-little-jerry",143
"CELIA","Aw, man!","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","I'm not George Costanza.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","He's a ringer!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Where's the tamale guy? (The bell rings, and the cockfight begins.)","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Little Jerry!","the-little-jerry",143
"JERRY","Kramer!","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Stop the fight!","the-little-jerry",143
"GEORGE","Tamale!","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him.","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","So, how long are you gonna be in here for?","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?","the-little-jerry",143
"ELAINE","So, 10 to 14 months.","the-little-jerry",143
"KURT","Yeah.","the-little-jerry",143
"THE END"," THE END","the-little-jerry",143
"KRAMER","Well, that was alright, huh?","the-money",144
"EMILY","Yeah.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","Well, um, goodnight.","the-money",144
"EMILY","Goodnight.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","(quietly, to himself) Look at this.","the-money",144
"HELEN","Jerry, we can only stay four days.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.","the-money",144
"MORTY","Helen, did you pack my travel gym?","the-money",144
"HELEN","Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the","the-money",144
"MORTY","Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any","the-money",144
"JERRY","Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.","the-money",144
"HELEN","Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Am I finally getting a baby brother?","the-money",144
"HELEN","Jerry, be serious.","the-money",144
"MORTY","How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?","the-money",144
"JERRY","What? The Cadillac I bought for you?","the-money",144
"MORTY","It's too much car, Jerry.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?","the-money",144
"MORTY","I don't think we even use it.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.","the-money",144
"HELEN","We already sold it.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?","the-money",144
"MORTY","Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.","the-money",144
"HELEN","Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.","the-money",144
"JERRY","(exasperated) Ugh.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Kramer.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen)","the-money",144
"HELEN","Hi Kramer.","the-money",144
"MORTY","Hiya Kramer.","the-money",144
"JERRY","We're in the middle of a discussion here.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","Oh yeah? What about?","the-money",144
"HELEN","Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","What'd you get for it?","the-money",144
"MORTY","Jack Klompus gave us six grand.","the-money",144
"JERRY","You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?","the-money",144
"MORTY","(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the","the-money",144
"JERRY","(getting worked up) I don't need the money.","the-money",144
"MORTY","What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.","the-money",144
"JERRY","(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and","the-money",144
"HELEN","Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in","the-money",144
"KRAMER","Yeah, that def jam is a force.","the-money",144
"HELEN","Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales'","the-money",144
"JERRY","(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.","the-money",144
"KRAMER","Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had","the-money",144
"GEORGE","Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.","the-money",144
"ELAINE","So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?","the-money",144
"GEORGE","I'm going to the bathroom.","the-money",144
"ELAINE","Just, very interesting.","the-money",144
"JERRY","Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.","the-money",144
"COUNTERPERSON","Arabian mocha java?","the-money",144
"ELAINE","(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.","the-money",144
"JERRY","That Arabian is strong coffee.","the-money",144
"ELAINE","It's PLO blend.","the-money",144
"ELAINE","Ohh, I got your coffee.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...","the-money",144
"ELAINE","(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-money",144
"ELAINE","Bye.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","Mmm.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","You see what just happened here?","the-money",144
"JERRY","What?","the-money",144
"GEORGE","She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.","the-money",144
"JERRY","And you misinterpret this how?","the-money",144
"GEORGE","She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.","the-money",144
"JERRY","I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.","the-money",144
"JERRY","You're crazy.","the-money",144
"GEORGE","(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.","the-money",144
"JERRY","George.","the-money",144

"GEORGE","(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","State champs.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Who's your favorite chess player?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","(Hesitating, he mumbles) Nastercoff?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","(Sighs) I don't know.. I made it up. (Gets up to leave) I'm never gonna get this thing.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Hey.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm,","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","What? What happened?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Well, what does that mean?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","(Sees a pay phone) Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends on the way to the phone)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"MELISSA","Ellen.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward Jerry, then goes back to the phone)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"MELISSA","Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KIM","Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KIM","(Casually) No.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"MELISSA","See ya!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Any messages?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","Yeah, no one called.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Yeah?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Is he smart?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Hey! Just like you pretend to be.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","get, um, started..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Interested) You don't say.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","But, that didn't happen to you.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","No, I - I really don't think you can do that.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","No, this is brand new. Do you like it?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","(Laughs) No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","I guess that's all right.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELLEN","Is something wrong, Jerry?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve -","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","Is that right?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","I think I'd really like to be a city planner. (Sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","Well, that's a good point.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Mutters) No, it's not.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Irritated) It's called a T-square.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations,","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","Thank you.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"WYCK","Susan would be proud of what you're doing.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","Thank you.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","My whole lot?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Name your price, man!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Thinks) 1500 dollars.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","I'll give you half that.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Excited) Done!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","What happened to Bob Saccamano?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Alright, well, now that's something..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Well, I guess I was..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Alright, I think I got enough for one day.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah, chew on that.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Oh, thanks. I've got plans.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Elaine, you should be there to document it.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","You're spending the weekend with Ellen?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(To Kramer) You want to start?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","What?!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Where is this coming from? She's great!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","There's nothing wrong with my career!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Which one?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","They were all like that!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Oh.. nice.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","What about architect, Steven?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","What do ya mean?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","You signed the release.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","He sat in mud. Not you.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","But I did sit in mud.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Pleading) I was all dirty!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","It ever happened! Understand?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Hey, now, they're tough cookies.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","You mean, like, a former member?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Is my toaster oven on there?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Yes! I'm a writer.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Make them interesting.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","What? Wheren't they just here?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Maybe we could all have dinner later?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Damn!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"JERRY","What?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","How much did you pay for them?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out ""Newman!"")","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Well, it started out nicely: ""I'm returning some pants."" A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) ""I set of down a train tunnel."".. (turns page) But that's","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"SECRETARY","I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Picks up the phone) Peterman, here.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","You want to know something? I no longer need them!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"ELAINE","No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"KRAMER","Yippie-yi-yay!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"PETERMAN","(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Hey, Van B. Boys.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)","the-van-buren-boys",146
"STEVEN","That's not the sign.","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!","the-van-buren-boys",146
"GEORGE","Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)","the-van-buren-boys",146

"STEINBRENNER","All right George, you can handle that.","the-nap",150
"STEINBRENNER","Costanza what the hell are you doing?","the-nap",150

"MARCY","How'd he look?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Okay. I wouldn't see it again.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Really? What happened?","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada.""","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Is ""yada yada"" bad?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","She is succinct.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Yeah, dentist of the stars.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What's up?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Excuse me?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Thanks.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Hey, where you just at the health club?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Booze is not a religion.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","What a succinct story.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Are you close with your parents?","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Yada what?","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Yada yada yada...","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Well, you too seem to have the same taste.","the-yada-yada",151
"JULIE","Well I like it, too.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Well I have the same shirt.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.","the-yada-yada",151
"JULIE","I like your shirt too.","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","Oh, so do I.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Oh. (Waiter approaches table)","the-yada-yada",151
"WAITER","Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","I like Merlot.","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","I love Merlot.","the-yada-yada",151
"JULIE","I'm crazy about Merlot.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","I live for Merlot.","the-yada-yada",151
"WAITER","We're out of Merlot.","the-yada-yada",151
"AGENT","So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, yeah.","the-yada-yada",151
"AGENT","Do you socialize with them often?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.","the-yada-yada",151
"AGENT","Oh.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Oh, you're in here.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What're you doing here?","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","I knew you had an appointment.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well this is very awkward.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Hey, what this thing? Whew!","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","George...","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Um...","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hey.","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Those aren't mahtzah balls.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I know, but...","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","5000.","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Why are you so concerned about this?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)","the-yada-yada",151
"PHONE","Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","I don't believe that.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Why were you holding the door open for?","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","Let's just put they're names in a hat.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","I'm not sure she was my type.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Oh, everybody's your type.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","What the hell does that mean?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","You've been married three times.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","All right, take it easy.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Hey, hey, hey!","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","That's not bad.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","All right, so we let the girls decide.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","No, no one wears the shirt next time.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","That's right, 'cause they already saw it.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","We'll look like idiots. (They exit)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","So what's she doing now?","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Yada.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","Well our adoption application was denied.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Really.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","How you doing?","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Whatley. (Like ""Newman"")","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","What are they doing here?","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","All right, I'll take Julie.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","All right, I'll take Karen.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.""","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","So what're you gonna do?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Thought it would be nice.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Poor Beth.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Hey, Arnie's just as upset.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh screw him! (George enters)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Really?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","But you yada yada'd over the best part.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","No, I mentioned the bisk.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Well, I gotta do somethin'.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","George is already in there.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I thought you were leaning towards Julie.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Well it was a helluva yada yada.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Okay.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Tell me about the free facial.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Which one?","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Bloomingdale's.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Very good. Go on.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Shoplifting.","the-yada-yada",151
"MARCY","Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Excuse me, Mother?","the-yada-yada",151
"NUN","Sister.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?","the-yada-yada",151
"NUN","Well not until tomorrow.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hmm, I really need to speak with him.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","That's a kneeler.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","Tell me your sins, my son.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","That's no sin.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","And this offends you as a Jewish person.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","Well.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","I haven't heard that one.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father starts laughing) Father...","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","Um...","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Newer magazines.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","Jerry, I gotta talk to you.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Hi.","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","Hi, Kramer.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Got a minute?","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Sure.","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Hi.","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","All right, shut up!","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Again you are telling me to shut up?","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","What?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.","the-yada-yada",151
"ARNIE","All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","(In pain) Oh, are you about done?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Huh?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","Father Curtis told me about your little joke.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What about all your Jewish jokes?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","The Jews?","the-yada-yada",151
"TIM","No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Date with Karen?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","No, Julie. She's the one.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What happened to Karen?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Those people, listen to yourself.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What?","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Kramer, he's just a dentist.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","I am not an anti-dentite!","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","They do have their own schools!","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","Yeah!","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","One little baby, whatever you have in stock.","the-yada-yada",151
"AGENT","Miss Benes...","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well, what's wrong?","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Talk to me.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","But we just got married.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","Why would Elaine do that to me?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.","the-yada-yada",151

"MICKEY","Karen and I are getting married.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.","the-yada-yada",151

"BETH","Two.","the-yada-yada",151
"MICKEY","You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Beth and Arnie broke up.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","So they don't want a baby?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","(Shaking his head no) Pff.","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hey, where's Marcy?","the-yada-yada",151
"GEORGE","She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hey, Kramer, over here.","the-yada-yada",151
"KRAMER","I just assume not sit next to you.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.","the-yada-yada",151

"MR. ABBOTT","Hey Kramer.","the-yada-yada",151
"JULIE","Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Hi, Mr. Abbott.","the-yada-yada",151
"MR. ABBOTT","That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","What was that all about?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","What?","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","A dentist. (They laugh)","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","That's a good one. Dentists.","the-yada-yada",151
"BETH","Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile)","the-yada-yada",151
"ELAINE","Where's Beth?","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","She went out to get her head shaved.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.","the-yada-yada",151
"JERRY","Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.","the-yada-yada",151
"FATHER","Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit)","the-yada-yada",151
"KAREN","(To Kramer) I really wanted you.","the-yada-yada",151

"JERRY","What're you doing with a pricing-gun?","the-millennium",152
"ELAINE","That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over","the-millennium",152
"JERRY","(to himself) Still a rip-off.","the-millennium",152
"JERRY","Hello?","the-millennium",152
"VALERIE","Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her","the-millennium",152

"STEINBRENNER","Macho head games?","the-millennium",152

"GEORGE","I'm still watching them.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","You look like a tourist.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","All right, let me ask you something: When do you start to worry about ear hair?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","When you hear like a soft russeling.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Oh right, the new job, how is it?","the-muffin-tops",153

"WOMAN","I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR LIPPMAN","So you just eat the tops.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.","the-muffin-tops",153

"ELAINE","Mr Lippman?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","So you're pretending to be a tourist?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","How do you explain your apartment?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","I got a hotel room.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","you moved into a hotel?","the-muffin-tops",153

"JERRY","So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","So?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.","the-muffin-tops",153

"MR. LIPPMAN","Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","You want a muffin or not?","the-muffin-tops",153

"GEORGE","Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.","the-muffin-tops",153

"MARY ANNE","And I'm still going to be here.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","(laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","What is it she think you can't do?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Find a job. Get an apartment.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","How did you do those things?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Here you go, here you go, check it out.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","What's desert?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","He eats those?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Talk to me.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Understand?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","So? What do you want me to do about it?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","So what do we with the bottoms?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","That's a good idea.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","No. No. It is.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","What? Can't I get a moment's peace?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","What are you doing to yourself?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Oh that's an old wives tale.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Is it? Look at this.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Oh, hi.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","You been enjoying them?","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","They're just stumps.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Well they're perfectly edible.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","No no, we just thought...","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","The homeless don't like them.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Fine.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?""","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","We were just trying to help.","the-muffin-tops",153
"REBECCA","Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","I think I might.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","$2300.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Ouch. A month?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.","the-muffin-tops",153
"WOMAN","Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Why do I have to go on the tour?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Hey, how's business?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","You got any room on that thing?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Yeah there are a few seats still available.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","No they don't.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Are they war veterans?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Wow this is your office.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Wait a minute George.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the ""o""'s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ALEX","You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","You also shouldn't use a donut.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...","the-muffin-tops",153
"TAPE PLAYER","Turn music off.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Can we just go?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","And go we will.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","What is this? A piece of pound cake?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","And we're off.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","(the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JOHN TYLER","(the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JOHN TYLER","How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","How do you make that alcoholic chicken?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JOHN TYLER","Let if ferment, just like everything else.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. STEINBRENNER","That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","I was going to dump this.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","It doesn't look like garbage.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Well it's muffin stumps","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","Where are the muffin tops?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","Can't do it.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Is this a joke?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","That's what I'd like to know about it.","the-muffin-tops",153
"ALEX","You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","What's that?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ALEX","Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Oh. Yeah.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","Where are we going?","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.","the-muffin-tops",153
"WAITRESS","So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","What clothes?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MAN","These clothes. The ones you're wearing.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","I don't know where the tops are.","the-muffin-tops",153
"KRAMER","Jerry what's the matter?","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.","the-muffin-tops",153
"BARTENDER","Hey, you looking for George?","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","Yeah.","the-muffin-tops",153
"BARTENDER","He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.","the-muffin-tops",153
"GEORGE","(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MARY ANNE","I told you this city would eat you alive.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","What is this guy again?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.","the-muffin-tops",153
"NEWMAN","Hello Elaine. Where are they?","the-muffin-tops",153
"ELAINE","In the back.","the-muffin-tops",153
"NEWMAN","All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.","the-muffin-tops",153
"MR. LIPPMAN","What is going on here?","the-muffin-tops",153
"NEWMAN","If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.","the-muffin-tops",153
"THE END"," THE END","the-muffin-tops",153
"JERRY","Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I got to give the players most of the credit for that.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, buses.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","No, I don't know who was doing that.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Here you go. Your latte, your cappuccino.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Maybe I should ask her out?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","She is a good waitress.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","You're going to the Tony's?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","They're musicians. That's not a joke.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","It's a funny observation.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","They did it for three years. What's another few months.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I'm really going to do something with these three months.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Like what?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I've always wanted to do that...","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I'm gonna play frolf.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","You mean golf?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Who's that?","the-summer-of-george",154
"DUGAN","That's Sam, the new girl in the counting.","the-summer-of-george",154
"WALTER","What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis.","the-summer-of-george",154
"DUGAN","She walks like orangutan.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Better call the zoo.","the-summer-of-george",154
"DUGAN","Reer...","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","What?","the-summer-of-george",154
"WALTER","ssssss...","the-summer-of-george",154
"DUGAN","Cat-ty...","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Like this? (imitates the walk)","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Yes, exactly.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","That's so strange.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","That is so stupid.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Reer.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Boy, your really packing it all in.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Like what?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Stomach ache?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","I drank too much water in the shower.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Shadow!","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","You're going to the Tony's too?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Roger that.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Where are you sitting?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","How did you get that job?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What academy?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, he didn't say (leaves).","the-summer-of-george",154

"KRAMER","My job. What are you doing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","So, you and Lyle are roommates?","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","No.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Gay?","the-summer-of-george",154

"LANETTE","No.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Are you sure?","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","I think I would know.","the-summer-of-george",154

"MR. GRAHAM ON TV","Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise!","the-summer-of-george",154
"SAM","Elaine, am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.","the-summer-of-george",154
"SAM","My arms?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.","the-summer-of-george",154
"SAM","I a caveman?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","No no no no, it's just...","the-summer-of-george",154

"GEORGE","She had a dude?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","How do you know it was her dude?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What do you think it could've been just some dude?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I reckon.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Dude!","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","It's 10:30 in the morning?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I tell you; I'm wiped.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","De-compressing.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","You didn't give that thing back?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","That's because you didn't win.","the-summer-of-george",154

"SAM","No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","See, yeah, that's all I was saying.","the-summer-of-george",154
"SAM","How's this (Sam hits a pen case out of the table), or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right).","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Hi!","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","No rush.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LYLE","Hey, Jerry! What's up?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY TO HIMSELF","I have absolutely no idea.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Who's that?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","It's Kramer.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hey Kramer.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","George says hi.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","How's that Tony?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Why don't you just come over?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","He's looking on to fridgerator.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I can't do this.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","So, what's George doing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","He's not doing anything. Goodbye!","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Oh, hello.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","I'm going.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Congratulations!","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","All right, all right.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I said no! (hangs up the phone.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. I'd rather be with you.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Just me? No dudes or fellas?","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","What you think?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I can start right away.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","But not here. (They leave.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","...so I said to him: Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Hey, eh, Lew!","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","We need to talk.","the-summer-of-george",154
"PETERMAN","Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","This. My office. Sam trashed my office.","the-summer-of-george",154
"PETERMAN","Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.","the-summer-of-george",154
"PETERMAN","Woof!","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Do you mean ""reer?""","the-summer-of-george",154
"PETERMEN","Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Now, what time are you picking me up tonight?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Eh, what?","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Should I ware the outfit I bought today?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Sure.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Which one?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","The one with the...(mumbles.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you called.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Ok, ok...","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Do you mind?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","No, I'll crab it.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hey, I've done that today.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What, did you lose your remote?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Not.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","No, no...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","No, because that's...","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Here.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I'm trying.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","No.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless...","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Anything...","the-summer-of-george",154
"MALCOLM","Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, she's fantastic....","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","She's a train wreck.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MALCOLM","There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","It is a gut wrenching scene.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MALCOLM","But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting.","the-summer-of-george",154
"MR. GRAHAM","There's lot of this (swings his arms) in tap dancing.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?","the-summer-of-george",154
"MALCOLM","No, we want you to fire her.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","She seems very nice.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I'm in show business.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Yayaya...","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Did you tell Peterman about this?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Cat fight?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Yeye cat fight!","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","T-t-t-t...","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","You got the tickets?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Yeah, two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I like it.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","A little notice would've helped! How many people?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","35, and George, on the invitations...","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Right on time, I like that.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I like your nails, that is a great color.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Love the sweater.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","This old thing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hi, I need some party invitations.","the-summer-of-george",154
"CLERK","Okay, have you been in here before?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","About a year ago. Wedding invitations.","the-summer-of-george",154
"CLERK","Right, how did that all work out?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","No complaints.","the-summer-of-george",154
"CLERK","Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","""You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale.""","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Ms. Welch.","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","Who are you?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! (hangs up) Kids! You're still here.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","What kind of problem?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","Out with it!","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...","the-summer-of-george",154
"GUY","Little help?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hey, frolf?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GUY","Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Yeah, sure.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GUY","Ok, come on.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Ok, let's towel it up.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","But we're in towels.","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE","Jerry.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","all right. One second.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Hello.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!","the-summer-of-george",154
"LANETTE COMES BY","Did you shave your chest hair?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","All right, All right, keep your towel on.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","...what?","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","It's a joke.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Look, just because I'm a woman...","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature!","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Aren't you Raquel Welch?","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","You know who I am. Now, what are you doing?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...","the-summer-of-george",154
"RAQUEL","That's it, you are going down.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","So how's George?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Tony.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What happened to you?","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Raquel Welch!","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Yikes.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","What happened to you?","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Raquel Welch!","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","The woman is a menace.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Cat fight with Raquel Welch.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Yey eye ca-catfight.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","My god, George!","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Back on the rack.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","With the two of us?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","I think we're still a man short.","the-summer-of-george",154
"DOCTOR","Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity.","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Well, that's good news.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","Wow, invitations again...","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","Yeah, that's weird.","the-summer-of-george",154
"ELAINE","All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?","the-summer-of-george",154
"JERRY","Yeah...","the-summer-of-george",154
"KRAMER","I'd like to get some coffee.","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.","the-summer-of-george",154
"THERAPIST","Now, swing them...swing...swing them, just swing them.","the-summer-of-george",154
"SAM","I can't do it. It's hard!","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","Still a little summer left.","the-summer-of-george",154
"THE END"," THE END","the-summer-of-george",154
"GEORGE","What is Holland?","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","No, that's the Netherlands.","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","Holland *is* the Netherlands.","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","Then who are the Dutch?","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","Well why didn't we?","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","What if we grew muttonchops?","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","No.","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.","the-butter-shave",155

"GEORGE","Killed.","the-butter-shave",155

"GEORGE","And you're the shark?","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.","the-butter-shave",155

"PUDDY","Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner. No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?","the-butter-shave",155

"PUDDY","What?","the-butter-shave",155
"ELAINE","I can't take this any more! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!","the-butter-shave",155

"KRAMER","Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.","the-butter-shave",155

"GEORGE","Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","How can you do this?","the-butter-shave",155
"GEORGE","Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.","the-butter-shave",155
"JERRY","He drove a car with no arms?","the-butter-shave",155

"GEORGE","You miss her.","the-butter-shave",155

"KRAMER","Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hey, I called you last night, where were you?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","George?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","(looking guiltier) No, no...no.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Well, I was here, that's everyone (laughing).","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","(laughing).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Are those the same shoes as yesterday?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Your hair, it's somewhat de-poofed.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","It's the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Wait a second, what's going on here?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Nothing, nothing.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(screams).","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","(screams).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Hoochie moochie. (haha)","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hand it over. Pay up.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","No! It's an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Then what do you call it? People don't just bump into each other and have sex. This isn't cinemax.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Ah, dinner! That's it, you're all the way back!","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Ugh!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Sex, that's meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that's heavy. That's like an hour.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Good Morning!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Hi Allison, that's a nice dress.","the-voice",156
"ALLISON","Don't even look at me.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Hey Glenn!","the-voice",156
"GLENN","Hey, go tell hell!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Heard that one already.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","...So that's the bedroom. Here's the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen...Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","And you are?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Oh, hey, I'm Darren. I'm new here.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Yeah, that's Jerry, you don't have to worry about him. Why don't you go across the hall and get started on that mail.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Right!","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","He's a go getter!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Who's he?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Alright.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Alright, it's time to go.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Jerry, it's not for people, it's for oil tankers.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(sarcastically) I know!","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won't spill out.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Actually, that is not a bad idea.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","(smiles) yeah.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Now, it's time to go.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hello","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (He's sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what's going on?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Seize montality, (Sp?) Jerry. They really want me out of here. They've downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I'm like Hitler's last days here.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So, are you going to leave?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Oh no! I'm vigilant. They'll never get me out. I'm like a weed, Jerry.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I thought you're like Hitler in the bunker?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I'm a weed in Hitler's bunker.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I'm getting another call, see ya...(answers call) Hello!","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Hi, this is Darren from Kramer's office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk's coffee shop.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(looking shocked) Really? When?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No, I don't.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Well, I'll call back in 5 minutes to confirm.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Yeah, 5.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hey! So, where's my money?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Oh yeah, hold on.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry's office. (Elaine is looking confused). We're going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he's already left?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","What? When did this happen?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Well, just...","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","(yelling) DARREN!","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy's. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I'll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That's funny. That's really funny. That's really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Do you have to write all this stuff down.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn't want to miss anything.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So, how hot did it get?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I don't know, 120, 130...Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I guess you can take anything, but actual work.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Bring it on!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(doing the voice) La la la.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Sorry I couldn't get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his ""intern"")","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit...","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Uh huh...","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(Interrupts) And I still say he's naked under there!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Oh that makes a lot of sense.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Oh, shut up!","the-voice",156
"DARREN","...Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld's drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, ""This never happened."" (Jerry then spits out the water).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(giggling)","the-voice",156
"CLARE","What's so funny?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Oh, nothing. (still giggling)","the-voice",156
"CLARE","What are you laughing about? Tell me.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We've been doing this silly, dumb voice.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","So is it fun humiliating me?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No, it's not you. It's your stomach, he's taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","So you think I'm fat?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No it's...","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Mr. Kramer says, ""hey buddy!""","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hey, we're kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(Screams) GET OUT!","the-voice",156
"CLARE","I'm leaving too.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No body said you're fat. He's a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","He is fat!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No, he's just a little bloated.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","Good-bye!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","It's mostly water weight.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Mr. Kramer...Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Yeah, well nothing before noon.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Line two?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Yeah, your phone is line one.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Oh...","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","See, this is what Jerry's doesn't understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn't mean we are back together.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Not having to do all that...you know...work.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Well, either way...","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","All that calling you, and buying you stuff...","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","David...","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Caring about how everyone at work isn't as smart as you. It's brutal.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Alright that's it! We're back together!","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Oh, no.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Look Elaine, be reasonable.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Get those clothes off. You're going to spend the night and we're going to cuddle.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","What?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","You heard me. Strip!","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(whistling)....(laughing)....Alright......OK....","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(on phone ... calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? ...Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) I'M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?","the-voice",156
"DEAN JONES","I've been reviewing Darren's internship journal. Doing laundry...","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","...Yeah.","the-voice",156
"DEAN JONES","...Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it's business as usual at Kramerica.","the-voice",156
"DEAN JONES","As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","And with Darren's help, we'll get that chicken.","the-voice",156
"DEAN JONES","I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darren to continue working with you.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.","the-voice",156
"DEAN JONES","You fly is open.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So you're sure you're not still angry about last night?","the-voice",156
"CLARE","No, I'm fine. Just as long as you don't ever do that voice again.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Never?","the-voice",156
"CLARE","Never.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","What about if you're not around?","the-voice",156
"CLARE","No!","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?","the-voice",156
"CLARE","That's right.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I can do that.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","So what's your decision?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-voice",156
"CLARE","Jerry...HI.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","You broke up with her? Why?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What's the matter?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I think I'm getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I think I like the girl better than the voice.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Really?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Still?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I told you.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Yeah, well not for long. I'm breaking up with him.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","No, I don't think so. I've seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It's kismet.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Double or nothing.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Done.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(talking from bathroom) Witness?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","You're in there again.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I think Play Now is putting something in my food.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Alright, I'm out of here.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn't fit him).","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","I don't know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven't been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I'm clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Yeah. Nine o'clock.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Really?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","So played.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I told you.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","I don't care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Kramerica is no more.","the-voice",156
"DARREN","What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, you're still here?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","I haven't had time to leave.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, I haven't changed my mind.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I'll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let's get back to work!","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Let's see what Jerry has to eat.","the-voice",156
"THOMASSOULO","You win George. We've had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That's half of your entire contract. Please...just go.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.","the-voice",156
"THOMASSOULO","Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza's handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Well played.","the-voice",156
"THOMASSOULO","I'll see you in hell Costanza.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in ... Jerry asks George) So we definitely don't want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, we're back together again, great. Bye bye.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Trouble down at the plant?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","It's a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","You have to drink that whole thing?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","No. No. No. It's for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I understand (not really understanding, lol).","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Would a giant rubber ball work?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Conceivably.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don't we test your bladder system at my office?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","You're not...","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there's nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think that's what he says)?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","I don't think so David, we're through.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Oh...That's a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Whew that was a dozy.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Go again?","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Book it.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(again from bathroom) Witness.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","David I know this hurts, but it's the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like he's going to still get some).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","I'm going to get some popcorn.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","So, how did it end?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","They got away.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","uh.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Listen David, I've got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Hey.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Did you bring the video camera?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I'll see ya.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I can't. I got to meet Clare.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","You gave up the voice?","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Darren?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Uh, bathroom.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Hey, use mine. I'll let you in.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I thought it was open to the public.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I uh, took care of that.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you're putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","I insist. I'll fix us a drink. (phone rings ... who would that be?) I got it.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would've said you're crazy... Now let's push this giant ball of oil out the window.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","So, check out my view.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Wow! Hey, there's Clare. I better go down.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Hey, there's Kramer & Darren.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","There's the giant ball of oil. Clare's right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!","the-voice",156
"CLARE","I don't believe this. I am not looking up if you're going to do that voice.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Bombs away (Uh oh).","the-voice",156
"JERRY","This is going to be a shame.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Hello.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Well, that didn't work. Hey, how about this...ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?","the-voice",156
"DARREN","Oh that sounds interesting sir.","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you're not going in anymore.","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So they're not paying you your...","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","No.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So you're pretty much...","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","What ever happened to Darren?","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","Darren is going away for a long long time.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that... (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil...","the-voice",156
"GEORGE","(doing the voice) I'm slippery as an eel...","the-voice",156
"KRAMER","(doing the voice) La la la.","the-voice",156
"JERRY","I'm just so glad it's back.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.","the-voice",156
"PUDDY","Elaine: I want to break up.","the-voice",156
"ELAINE","Ah nuts!","the-voice",156
"THE END"," THE END","the-voice",156
"FRANK","I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.","the-serenity-now",157
"ESTELLE","That's as far as it goes.","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.","the-serenity-now",157
"ESTELLE","I pulled it. It doesn't go.","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame","the-serenity-now",157
"GEORGE","All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal!","the-serenity-now",157
"GEORGE","What is that?","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets","the-serenity-now",157
"GEORGE","Are you supposed to yell it?","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","The man on the tape wasn't specific.","the-serenity-now",157
"GEORGE","What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?","the-serenity-now",157
"ESTELLE","I told you to fix that thing.","the-serenity-now",157
"FRANK","Serenity nowww!","the-serenity-now",157
"PATTY","So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish","the-serenity-now",157
"JERRY","Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.","the-serenity-now",157
"PATTY","Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.","the-serenity-now",157
"JERRY","What? All right, fine.","the-serenity-now",157
"PATTY","Are you mad at me?","the-serenity-now",157
"JERRY","No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.","the-serenity-now",157

"JERRY","Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?","the-blood",158
"MORTY","No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Did you give blood?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","In case of what?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Are we finished?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Done.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Yeah...","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","You haven't seen Jimmy for years.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Tomorrow evening, sure.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Do you know anyone responsible?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Do I know anyone??","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","What are you doing?","the-blood",158
"TARA","Incense, for the mood.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Um, cream soda?","the-blood",158
"TARA","Vanilla.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is: who's responsible for this?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","You just left? What did you tell her?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I don't know, I was starving Jerry!","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oh, pudding! You want some?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Elaine, what do you think?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.","the-blood",158
"BANK EMPLOYEE","Well, we can transfer to another bank for you.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","So eh, what do you say?","the-blood",158
"TARA","I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...","the-blood",158
"TARA","Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?","the-blood",158
"TARA","No.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Didn't go for it, huh?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","No.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What the hell is that?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Pudding skin singles.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh, why?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","I closed down my account at the blood bank.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What, it...it's here in the building?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Hey, working out?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","You know it and I ditched all my junk food.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","What the heck is going on here?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Is this about me?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","No.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh, then I lost interest.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","You? I'm more responsible than you are!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oh, Tara!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Kramer...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Don't take my money!","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","No, I'm the baby-sitter.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Elaine? What are you doing here?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","There was an incident.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Would you stop it.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What is this?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","It's Jell-O.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What about this? This is blood isn't it?!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Heads up!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Aaah...","the-blood",158
"JIMMY","You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I wish I was dead.","the-blood",158
"JIMMY","Can I have your juice?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","As long as you don't put...","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Thanks for the re-fill.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Hey, Elaine! How did it go?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Oh, he's...he's a joy...","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","It's not serious, is it?","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Aah!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I can see that! What happened?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I'll remember that.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Three pints of Kramer's blood?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Well, so much for purification week.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","So, how's the fornicating gourmet?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","George, we're trying to have a civilization here.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Hey, how was baby-sitting?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Really?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I'm not touching that thing.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh, no...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Hello?","the-blood",158
"HELEN","Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Kramer called you?","the-blood",158
"HELEN","He calls every week. Are you all right?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Yes, I'm fine.","the-blood",158
"HELEN","He says he's fine.","the-blood",158
"MORTY","Tell him to eat a plum.","the-blood",158
"HELEN","Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.","the-blood",158
"MORTY","Plum...(Jerry hangs up.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Why are you calling my parents?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Why here?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Ok...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Fine...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Ok!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Blood!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","All right.","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Hello, dough boy.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Elaine? Elaine?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Where's Jimmy?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","For what?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","All aboard in the pain train!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","How many session did my parents paid for?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!","the-blood",158
"TARA","Oh, George!","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)","the-blood",158
"TARA","George? George? What are you doing?! (Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.)","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Pleasuring you?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What is this?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","We're making sausages.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","I thought you were gonna watch a video.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","So, the free love buffet is over?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What's going on?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I think you're right. You gonna eat that?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","These fries are really really good...","the-blood",158
"JERRY","All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Uuh, sleepy.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Why did you get rid of that sausage?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What's wrong with yours?","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","I got no AC and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) ""If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, I can't do that.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Oh, mama...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Vivian...","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Elaine!","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Hi! This is my friend George.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Hi...","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Ok.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Really, why?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Her grandparent passed away five years ago.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","That's because it's underwater.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","This is insane.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Is it?","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Yes it it.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","You...very knowledgeable.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Very.","the-blood",158
"VIVIAN","Oh, wait...(Vivian turns the TV on.) Oohh...","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Vivian!!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Is this really necessary?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What if I can't keep up?","the-blood",158
"IZZY","You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.","the-blood",158
"IZZY JR.","Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...","the-blood",158
"IZZY AND IZZY JR","Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What's going on?","the-blood",158
"IZZY JR.","There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh my God, the blood!","the-blood",158
"IZZY JR.","Blood!!","the-blood",158
"IZZY","Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","So how long did they drag you?","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.","the-blood",158
"ELAINE","Hi George. Hi Jimmy.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Ouch!","the-blood",158
"JERRY","What's the kid doing here?","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Oh, that's a drag...","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","That kid...","the-blood",158
"JERRY","You put blood in the car?!","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.","the-blood",158
"KRAMER","You didn't get the blood from me.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Then who?","the-blood",158
"NEWMAN","Hello Jerry.","the-blood",158
"JERRY","Aaaaahhh...!!!","the-blood",158
"JERRY AND KRAMER","Aaaahhh...!!!","the-blood",158
"THE END"," THE END","the-blood",158
"GEORGE","Who was it?","the-junk-mail",159
"JERRY","I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.","the-junk-mail",159

"JERRY","Brave new world, alright.","the-junk-mail",159
"JERRY","Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?","the-junk-mail",159

"JERRY","It's Sunday.","the-junk-mail",159
"GEORGE","Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?","the-junk-mail",159
"KRAMER","Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.","the-junk-mail",159

"JERRY","Are you insane? Give 'em to me.","the-junk-mail",159
"KRAMER","No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he","the-junk-mail",159
"GEORGE","Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect.","the-junk-mail",159

"NEWMAN","No! And no one will ever see you again!","the-junk-mail",159
"KRAMER","Are you through?","the-junk-mail",159
"NEWMAN","Yes. No, wait! OK, yes.","the-junk-mail",159
"KRAMER","Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.","the-junk-mail",159
"NEWMAN","There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!","the-junk-mail",159
"KRAMER","No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!","the-junk-mail",159
"NEWMAN","I know you know, but you don't know what I know.","the-junk-mail",159
"JERRY","Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?","the-junk-mail",159

"FRANKIE","So, can we go for a ride?","the-junk-mail",159
"JERRY","Yeah, let's just get out of here.","the-junk-mail",159

"GEORGE","What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","So Maranda's cooled on y'a?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","I'm getting nothing.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Yeah, me neither.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","I don't understand women.","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","Hey. What's going on?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Hey (sees coffee marks) Art Garfunkle?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","No, Castro.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Right.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","So he just sidles up?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","That's right! He's a real sidler.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Maybe you didn't see him.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making a cup of soup","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Hakuna Matata?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","I thought I was alone.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","That doesn't make it right.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup ...","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","Would you just let it go?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"JERRY","How did you get this in here?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","So where are you gonna sleep?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Yeah ... backstage.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","Phew! This chair smells like garbage.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","What?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys growing up.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Yeah, that was me.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had.","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"KRAMER","Right.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","And we all know how painful that can be.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","Jerry","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"KRAMER","tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ... what","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"KRAMER","(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break. .... Okay! We're back!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"MIRANDA","Then why don't you just run IT over too?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Zing.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"MIRANDA","George, what are you doing?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"MIRANDA","What pigeon? You drove right onto that squirrel. (leaves the car)","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"CELIA","Jerry! Those hands! They never stop!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"CELIA","No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","(quietly standing behind Lou) Thank you. ha ha","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"MIRANDA","Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but it would be costly,","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Well, uh, are there any other options?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","We could put him to sleep.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","What might that cost?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"NEWMAN","(laughs)El Paso!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","What's he here for?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's going on with you? I understand","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear wedding bells?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","Are you married right now?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","I told you he was a risk.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"GEORGE","More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought:","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"CELIA","What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY AND GEORGE","Triptaphen.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","... I think. Have some more wine.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"CELIA","What video did you get?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Four hours.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","More heavy gravy?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","(playing with toys) Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. you know.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","We've got no one!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"NEWMAN","What about a guest-host?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","I'll pretend I didn't hear that.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"MIRANDA","Doctor, how's the squirrel?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Is he dead?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"MIRANDA","Yes he would.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","You have 30 minutes. (exits)","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"DOCTOR","One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","He has no home. He's a squirrel.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"DOCTOR","Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","What about my ""questionable material""?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" is coming to your apartment?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","Well, I practically raised his kids.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. Can I bring the squirrel by?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"KRAMER","What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I got that problem solved.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Tic-Tacs worked?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","He's a human maraca.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"GEORGE","Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","You took him over to Celia's?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","What? It's a victimless crime.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"JERRY","Okay, one victim.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","I think it's unconscionable.","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"PETERMAN","That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"ELAINE","No Mister Peterman.","the-merv-griffin-show",160
"PETERMAN","Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can And if you are undead -","the-merv-griffin-show",160

"ELAINE","(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","You won't regret this, sir.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","I don't care. Let's find you an office.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","The boom box incident?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Seems reasonable.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Even more reasonable.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","And that guy is your new boss?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Like retouched.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Neither have I.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Hey, our meat problems are solved.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Where did you get this thing?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Yeah, that's pretty good.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Sara Sitarides?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Mmhu.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What's with you?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Your whole building smells like potatoes.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","How do you do that?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I think we might have one left in the stock room.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","This hallway smells like potatoes.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I think I'll let you do it.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","No, I really don't want to.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, I don't want to either.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I thought you had done this before.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","It's just...it's no picnic.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Well, how are we gonna do it?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh mama.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Are you okay?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","I will lose that nail.","the-slicer",161
"SARA","I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Well, I have this neighbor...","the-slicer",161
"SARA","A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","No.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Cause I hit a whopper last week!","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","I thought you said you wanted to be out?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","You've really lost a lot of hair.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I am aware!","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE THINKING","Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","The cat.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","He took out Kruger?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","This slicer is indomitable.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Where did you get that butcher's coat?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","What did he do about it?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh, that's a prickly one.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Yeah, how's the doctor date?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Dermatology?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Yes, she's a dermatologist.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","The slicer! Elaine, let's go.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Where are we going?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","When are you going on your next date with her?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Oh, what's the point?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Flowers?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","So, you've done this?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","I think we are looking half a millimeter.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Can it cut that thin?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","How did you know you cut it?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, I guess I just assumed.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Yeah, that's a hall of famer.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Alright, let's do it.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh no, I don't think so.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Why not?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, you're not checked at on it.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","What do I have to know?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, where the meat goes?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Right there.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Where do you turn it on?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Right there.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","But where does the meat go?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","It's fine.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!","the-slicer",161
"SARA","What is with you?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!","the-slicer",161
"PARRY","Dr. Sitarides?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Mr. Parry, how are you?","the-slicer",161
"PARRY","I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","She saved your life?","the-slicer",161
"PARRY","I had skin cancer.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Skin cancer! Damn.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","Here you Mr. Costanza.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","What is this? This is a drawing.","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","Looks real, doesn't it?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","This is a cartoon!","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!","the-slicer",161
"CLERK","Then you better get a camera.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","He looks like a Peanuts character.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","You can do that.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Without his shirt on.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","It seemed so disorganized.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I understand.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","True. You mean, for you?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I think.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What about your sea sickness?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Maybe I could be a land guy.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I don't know if they have land guys.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Pliers?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Drawer.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Got it.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What are they for?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Come again?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Eh, it went okay.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Yeah, I started out real classy...","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Yeah you did, you classed it up!","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","But then I found out about the skin cancer.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Oh, so it backfired?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Aha.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Could she do that at Kruger?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I don't know, I guess.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","You have a little thing for this fella'?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Must I?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","How does that reflect me?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Ok, I'll go with you.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Was it pimple popper MD?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","That's the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.)","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Still got it.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Out, damn heal!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Elaine?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Kramer?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Just hold on!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Hey, what's going on?","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)","the-slicer",161
"NEIGHBOR","Hey, get the hell out of here!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What the hell is this?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","No.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, what have you been doing?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","There, there's your hives.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What, she gave me hives?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","She did kind of touch my face.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Oh, that's fantastic.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.","the-slicer",161
"SARA","What record?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","His personal file, I, I don't ask...","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Jerry? What brings you here?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Looks like hives.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Where do you suppose that could've come from?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Jerry, what are you doing...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","He is just setting the record straight.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?","the-slicer",161
"SARA","Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I want the antidote, pimple popper!","the-slicer",161
"SARA","That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Doc, huh?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","This is it. I can take this anymore.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","So, how am I looking?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Kramer, I really owe you one.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","George, we got a problem.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","What?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Because, you're not a dermatologist.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Whoa, whoa, a section?!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","No! Absolutely Not!","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!","the-slicer",161
"NEIGHBOR","Turn it off! Turn it off!","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!","the-slicer",161
"NEIGHBOR","Alright, that's it!","the-slicer",161
"ELAINE","Yeah, the address is 78th West...","the-slicer",161
"NEIGHBOR","Oh, oh mama...","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","So, Kramer pulled it off?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Why don't you see someone about it?","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.","the-slicer",161

"GEORGE","You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","I don't want this on my conscience.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Yeah, alright...","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, that's weird.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","What are you doing?","the-slicer",161
"KRAMER","Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.","the-slicer",161
"JERRY","That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!","the-slicer",161

"KRUGER","I'm not too worried about it.","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?","the-slicer",161
"GEORGE","Whatever.","the-slicer",161
"KRUGER","Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.","the-slicer",161

"KRAMER","Oh, geez..","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(From outside the apartment) Hello?","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?","the-betrayal",162
"ZUBIN","Please, call us Usha and Zubin.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Oh. Well, Usha..","the-betrayal",162
"ZUBIN","I'm Zubin.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke..","the-betrayal",162
"USHA","You're not going to the wedding, are you?","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Well..","the-betrayal",162
"USHA","Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.","the-betrayal",162
"ZUBIN","You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!","the-betrayal",162
"USHA","Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.","the-betrayal",162
"ZUBIN","If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","(Leaving) That's fantastic.","the-betrayal",162
"ZUBIN","And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.","the-betrayal",162
"NINA","Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.","the-betrayal",162
"NINA","Really?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.","the-betrayal",162
"NINA","I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..","the-betrayal",162
"NINA","Heh.. yeah.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Probably the reason..","the-betrayal",162
"FDR","Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! (Slams the door in Kramer's face)","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","But you haven't seen..","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)","the-betrayal",162
"FDR","That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Well, why?","the-betrayal",162
"FDR","(Sinister) I have my reasons.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.","the-betrayal",162
"FDR","That's just a silly superstition. (Slams his door on Kramer)","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","FDR?","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(Guessing the look) Stink eye?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(Also guessing) Crook eye?","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","(Entroducing yet another type of look to the boys) EVIL eye.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', ""These are my friends?!""","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(Sarcasticly joking off what George said) Everyday is my birthday.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Hi.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","So you think it's a non-vite?","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(Showing Elaine his boots) Timberlands.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","Jerry, would you make the call already?","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","What call?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(Picks up the phone, dialing Nina) He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.","the-betrayal",162
"ELAINE","(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter tward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","I was kidding when I said that!","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","I'll have the clam casino.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Get outta here.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(Showing Jerry the menu) ""Chef recommends""","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Hmm..","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","(Motioning tward waitress) I think she likes me.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Sure.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Are you?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","Well, what's the reason?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","How engrossing?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need an awkward pause.","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear them every time I see her.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Why?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his meal) Hm.. tastes a little funky.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Oh, I'm sure it's fine.","the-betrayal",162
"ALL","..to you!","the-betrayal",162

"JERRY","Ah.","the-betrayal",162
"NINA","It's great talkin'","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?","the-betrayal",162
"GEORGE","How as the date?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Pretty good. I think she might be the one.","the-betrayal",162

"KRAMER","Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","What are you bringing snowballs in here for?","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard.. and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (Looks out the Monk's windows) there's my friend, FDR. I'm","the-betrayal",162

"KRAMER","Oh, hey, how you doing?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Oh.","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Uh, you need any help, or..?","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?","the-betrayal",162
"KRAMER","Uh, no, no, no. I couldn't impose.","the-betrayal",162
"JERRY","Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)","the-betrayal",162

"ELAINE","I don't believe this woman.","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","Talk to me, Babe.","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","What is this symbol?","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","It's a germ.","the-apology",163
"PEGGY","Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","Don't you? Elaine.","the-apology",163

"PEGGY","Really?","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","They're bacteria traps.","the-apology",163
"PEGGY","So you... just learned to live with it?","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","For the most part.","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.","the-apology",163

"MELISSA","Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?","the-apology",163
"JERRY","Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.","the-apology",163
"MELISSA","I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.","the-apology",163
"JERRY","Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...","the-apology",163
"JERRY","We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her","the-apology",163
"KRAMER","Hang on.","the-apology",163
"JERRY","So what are you up to?","the-apology",163
"KRAMER","Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you","the-apology",163

"HANKE","What?","the-apology",163
"KID","Can you get on that cone?","the-apology",163
"HANKE","Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking","the-apology",163
"GEORGE","Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice.","the-apology",163
"KID","Is there anybody else here but you?","the-apology",163
"HANKE","I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we","the-apology",163

"ELAINE","This food was in the shower with you?","the-apology",163
"KRAMER","Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.","the-apology",163
"PUDDY","Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!","the-apology",163
"GEORGE","Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?","the-apology",163

"GEORGE","Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!","the-apology",163
"HANKE","Please. Step Nine.","the-apology",163
"GEORGE","That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would","the-apology",163
"GEORGE","It wasn't funny.","the-apology",163
"HANKE","It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention","the-apology",163

"THE END"," THE END","the-apology",163
"ELAINE","So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?","the-strike",164

"TIM","Hey! Happy Chanukah!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hey, Tim. Great party.","the-strike",164
"TIM","(Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Shrugging it off) eh.","the-strike",164
"TIM","(Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)","the-strike",164
"TIM","(Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You have a standard fake?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Mm-hmm.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","Hi!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hi, I'm Jerry.","the-strike",164
"WOMAN","Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Why don't I give you my phone number?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Didn't you call in sick yesterday?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: ""We don't care, and it shows.""","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) ""Have you seen me?"" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next","the-strike",164
"JERRY","See? You give, and you get.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Reading the card from Whatley) ""This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance.""?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Oh, that's nice.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying ""I've given your gift to someone else!""","the-strike",164
"JERRY","To a children's charity!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Hey!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hey.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to ""Atomic Sub"" later.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","""Atomic Sub""? Why are you eating there?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","What does that mean?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Embarrassed) Free sub.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","What?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Nothing. It's a card from my dad.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" What is Festivus?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","It's nothing, stop it..","the-strike",164
"JERRY","When George was growing up..","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Interrupting) Jerry, No!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","His father..","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","No!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(pleading) Alright..","the-strike",164
"JERRY","And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Jerry! Stop it!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","So?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","No, you walk out.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","No, you wait for the movie!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean","the-strike",164
"JERRY","So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","That's a good idea.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","What strike?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Worked?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Bagels?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","What were your.. demands?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","I believe that's the new minimum wage.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Why didn't you ever mention this?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","All right, everybody! I'm back!","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Who are you?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Oh yeah! Kramer.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","NO, I""m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","I could use someone for the holidays..","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Those are rasin bagels.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","(Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.","the-strike",164
"CHARLIE","Elaine Benes?!","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.","the-strike",164
"CHARLIE","(faintly) I'm a man.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Ohh.. my..","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the","the-strike",164
"TIM","Hey, Jerry.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hey, Tim.","the-strike",164
"TIM","What's up?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.","the-strike",164
"TIM","Mazel Tov.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Jerry.. hi.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Gwen?","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Yeah.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Have you come across this?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Relating) Like the Batman villain?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Annoyed) If that helps you..","the-strike",164
"JERRY","So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Reading it) ""A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund."" - What is that?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(With pride) Made it up.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Continuing reading) ""The Human Fund. Money for people.""","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","What do you think?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","It has a certain understated stupidity.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","..Yeah.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","How was your first day?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Your hands were in the dough?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Happy Festivus!","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","What's Festivus?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","When George was growing up..","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Interrupting) No!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","His father..","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Happy Festivus, Georgie.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You're still trying to gget that free sub?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Is there a captain's hat involved in this?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Maybe.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Well, just tell me everything, huh?","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","What happened to the doll?","the-strike",164
"FRANK","It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. ""A Festivus for the rest of us!""","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","That musta been some kind of doll.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","She was.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)","the-strike",164
"SANDY","(After reading the cheap gift, she's suddenly unimpressed) ..Oh.. thanks. (Walks off)","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)","the-strike",164
"PHIL","Ow!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Not if you could see our books.. what's this?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","The Human Fund.","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Whatever. (Walks off)","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Is there a tree?","the-strike",164
"FRANK","No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Hello, Frank.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Hello, woman. (leaves)","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","But it's Festivus.","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","What?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","That's not a right.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","What? You're siding with management?!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","No, I just..","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Hey.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Boy, am I glad to see you.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","You were expecting someone else?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You never know.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","(To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?","the-strike",164
"GWEN","I can go either way.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","(Shocked) You're telling me.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","So, she was switching? Back and forth?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Lights out.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Oh, that's classy.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Well, Happy Festivus.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","What is that? Is taht the pole?!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Sulking) That's why I hate it.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Read that poem.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!","the-strike",164
"ESTELLE","Leave him alone!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","We had some good times.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Hey.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Hi.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","So, you ready to go?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","(To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","What did you do?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","You've been warned.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Oh, hi! (Waves at him)","the-strike",164
"WORKER","Hey, the steam valve's broke.","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Can we still make bagels?","the-strike",164
"WORKER","Sure. It's just a little steamy.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","20 thousand dollars?","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Why? It's our place.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","I just found a rubber band in my soup.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Oh.. I know who's cooking today!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Hey! Surprise, surprise!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Hey, Georgie!","the-strike",164
"GWEN","I think I'm just gonna go.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","I'll be here.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","She didn't touch it.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)","the-strike",164
"JERRY","20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I don't know.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Excuse me?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I'm serious.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","You're going to start your own charity?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Kramer, the vest just called.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that ""Atomic Sub"" card.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","And?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Kramer, Hi!","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Oh, hello.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Ah-huh.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","I'm dating your friend, Jerry..","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Oh, he's a tomcat.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Steve.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","Hmm?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","It's Elaine.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","From Tim Whatley's party?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","You look.. different.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","No, no, no. You give me your number.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","No.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","Typhoid?","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","No.","the-strike",164
"DENIM VEST","(Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","A fake number! Blimey!","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Well, there could be.","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","But there isn't.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Vemonous?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Are you making all this up, too?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","Yeah, you probably should.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Happy Festivus!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Have you seen the pole, Kruger?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","He's gonna see it.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Embracing my roots.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","They nailed you on the 20 G's?","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Busted cold.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","I find your belief system fascinating.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","Hello again, Miss Benes.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","What are you doing here?","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!","the-strike",164
"ESTELLE","Dinner's ready!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Let's begin.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Uh.. that's right.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Oh, God.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Jerry!","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Gwen! How'd you know I was here?","the-strike",164
"GWEN","Kramer told me.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Another Festivus miracle!","the-strike",164
"GWEN","I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.","the-strike",164
"ELAINE","(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?","the-strike",164
"BOOKIE","He had to be shot.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Not the feats of strength..","the-strike",164
"FRANK","This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.","the-strike",164
"JERRY","I thought you were on strike?","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?","the-strike",164
"KRUGER","(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Oh, please, somebody, stop this!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!","the-strike",164
"ESTELLE","I think you can take him, Georgie!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Oh, come on! Be sensible.","the-strike",164
"FRANK","Stop crying, and fight your father!","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!","the-strike",164
"FRANK","This is the best Festivus ever!","the-strike",164
"MANAGER","Alright. That's enough. You're fired.","the-strike",164
"KRAMER","Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)","the-strike",164
"THE END"," THE END","the-strike",164
"GEORGE","When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","No. That's just electric.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Sarcastic) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Well, what do you think the big holdup is?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","And the underwater bubble cities?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","It's like we're living in the '50s here.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","It's good suspension!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Talking about the vein in George's head) There's that vein again.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","I guess he graduated.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","That's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Thank you.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptic) You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Sudeenly, you're","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Alright. Calm down.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Jerry, I don't think this thing is hooked up right.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(To Kramer) Alright, we're goin' in.","the-dealership",165
"SALESMAN","You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or lease?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying..","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Maybe I should talk to him.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Oh, I don't think so. No, he's an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That's where I come in.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","I see. So, you're his manag-","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, ""I'll walk out of here right now!""","the-dealership",165
"SALESMAN","Can I help you with something?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we're walkin'!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Still with a tone) He is. You don't know what I'm doin' here.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Hey.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Sorry I'm late.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Ah. Where'd you go?","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Arby's.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I had the roast beef..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","So, Puddy, I decided I'm gonna go with another 900 convertible.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Alright. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Oh. (Leaves for the room)","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I'll show you the 900.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.","the-dealership",165
"RICK",".. And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock breaks, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","No. No, I didn't.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Well, that's okay. (Pointing) We'll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","(Up to something) Well, it's a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I'm gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it'll handle my daily","the-dealership",165
"RICK","So where are we going?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Just a little place I like to call, ""You'll see"".","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I'm starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) Alright, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Don't think it can't happen! (Leaves)","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more ""grease monkey"".","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","I don't care for that term.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Oh. Sorry, I didn't know..","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","No, I don't know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","I saw one once that could do sign language.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Yeah, Koko.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Right, Koko. That chimp's alright. (Holds up his hand) High-five.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on here? (To Jerry) You didn't agree to anything, did ya?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No. We both just saw the same monkey.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Standing up) Well, there's a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Getting a dollar out) Where's your money?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Talking it) I'm here helpin' you.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Hey. Where's Puddy? The copy machine is broken.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That's what they want you to think.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I thought all guys do that.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they're using sign language now.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Is that bad?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","What do you think the Nazis were doin'? (Imitates the Nazi's salute) That was the heil-five.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Pointing out) Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80's, and it's still relatable today.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Good news. We got a 900 in black. That's the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Ah, come on!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar?","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","(While retrieving his candy) No.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","(While walking away) Don't have one.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Stopping him) Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I glanced inside, and I couldn't help but notice that you had several crisp dollar","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","(Calm) You're incorrect.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? I'm very hungry.","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","(While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You're all doin' a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho,","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","No, look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Let's see if","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they're too lazy to pick it up.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Either that, or they've got a little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don't you just go to the cashier?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","The cashier is at lunch - which is where I'd like to be.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","How much was under there?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Looking at his finger) I think somethin' bit me. I just need another nickel.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Ho, ho, ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Hey, can I have my dollar back?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Stingy) It's wrinkled. It's worthless.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on!","the-dealership",165
"MAN","They just put out some more donuts.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","They did?","the-dealership",165
"MAN","(Holding his up) Last one.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Well, just one more errand and we can head back.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Actually, it looks like we're gonna need some gas.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(Looking) Well, it's on ""E"".","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I","the-dealership",165
"I"," I","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend's car for free.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, it's gone.","the-dealership",165
"SALESMAN","Well, how do you know that one's yours?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must've bought one, and gotten both.","the-dealership",165
"SALESMAN","Sir, are you gonna buy a car?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door's window) Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Paper jam.. Got it! (Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","David, um, I..","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Still holding out his hand) Don't leave me hangin'","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","You're a salesman now - and the high-five is.. it's very grease monkey.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","What did I tell you about that?","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Well, that is really mature.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Yeah? So are you.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","You're the grease monkey.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Confused at David's attempts at a comeback) Uh.. that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Yeah, if you leave, we're through.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Fine! We're through!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(While leaving) That's right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you..?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Let's finish this up.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Did you two break up?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chick's whacked. We're history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things:","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","""Rust-proofing""?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Reading off what he's adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder's fee","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","""Finder's fee""? It was on the lot!","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Yeah, that's right. (Continues reading off) Floor mats, keys..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Keys""?!","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","How ya gonna start it?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","First of all, it wasn't a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Huh. You must think I'm pretty stupid. That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","Yeah, it's just a little nougat.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, let's not just say things that are obvious","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","(Pointing to George's forehead) You know, you're gettin' a little vein there..","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I can't believe this guy..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Hey, George!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he's treatin' me just like a regular customer, now!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There's now laws in this place. Anything goes! It's","the-dealership",165
"SALESWOMAN","Is someone helping you?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Stay back!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the ""E"".","the-dealership",165
"RICK","How long are you gonna go?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) get it out of your mind.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Have you ever been completely below the slash?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don't know who did it, and I never got to","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Whoop! Whoop!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","George! Can we focus on the car, here?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature, here, and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Yellow? I wanted black.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","I can't give you black at that price.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Pleading) George, could you help me, please?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Sing it, sister!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Exasperated) Uhhh..","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Losing it) ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or... Lem is not gonna get away with this!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(To Puddy) I'll be right back.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Okay.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Hey, George!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Is it just the angle I'm looking from?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","No, Sir. We are down there.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I've never felt so alive!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Yeah, well, alright. I'm satisfied. We better get some gas.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","What? Well, we can't stop now.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","What do you mean?","the-dealership",165
"RICK","We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","There was no plan.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Well, let's make it the plan! Let's just.. go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","What, they drove to a dealership?","the-dealership",165
"RICK","No, they drove off a cliff.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","You are one sick mama.. I like it.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Mr. Kramer, the road!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Yup! Yup!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Hello?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Over the phone) Elaine, you've got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin' me on this car, which is yellow now!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","What?!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Sarcastic) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","You're gonna get back together, anyway. It's thousands of dollars!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Oh, I don't know..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Come on. Then you don't have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Fine.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","And I didn't like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No. No lunch.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I'll hang the phone up right now!","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Alright! Lunch!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I'll see ya. (Hanging up the phone)","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Bye. (Hangs up)","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody's ripping me off!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","When did you bring the car in?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(To the man behind him in line) Yeah right.. I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet?","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","I thought you said it was a Twix.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Maybe it was.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","What about the $100,000 bar?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","No. Rice and caramel.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Nougat?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","No.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Positive?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Please.","the-dealership",165
"WOMAN","You know they changed the name from $100,000 bar to 100 Grand?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE SR","I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.","the-dealership",165
"MAN","What's the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE SR","Not Skittles.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don't talk.","the-dealership",165
"WOMAN","(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","He likes it!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?","the-dealership",165
"MAN","(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","No! There's no coconut!","the-dealership",165
"WOMAN","(Behind service window) I'm allergic to coconut.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","I'm not.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE SR","..A nickel!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","I'm with a customer.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Uh..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What's important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we'll talk about the car.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","(Like a kid) I don't want to get back with her. She's too bossy.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, you both find each","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE AND PUDDY","Right.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you..","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","I guess.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Good point.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","(Smiling, like a salesman) Alright. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","No, no coconut for me.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Alright, I'll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Ahh!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","No, man! Not the gas!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Do you think that this'll make you happy? Cause it won't!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, ""Kramer and that","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Maybe we better get moving.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","It's good to have you back, Stan.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","It's Rick, by the way.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","No time!","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","Mr. Costanza, I really don't have time for this.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claimed, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","""Candy line-up""?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","I've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select from.","the-dealership",165
"WILLIE","It took you an hour?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room.","the-dealership",165
"SALESWOMAN","Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","That's my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! They're - they're all on the floor!","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","No.","the-dealership",165
"MAN","Hey, this Clark bar is good.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","It's a Twix! They're all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And you've robbed it! You've all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!","the-dealership",165
"MECHANIC","They're all gone.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx!","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","What was that?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","There's a mental hospital right near here.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby's - no more than once a month. In exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, that's not bad.","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","I can live with that.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","So, you're back together?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Yeah.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","Alright, alright. Alright, that's enough! Let's get back to my deal. That undercoating, that's just a rip-off, isn't it, David?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Oh, we don't even know what it is.","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","So, I'm gettin' the insider's deal?","the-dealership",165
"PUDDY","Insider's deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","(Seeing the turn-off up ahead) There's the dealer!","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Hey!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","We did! We pulled it off! I can't believe it! Where's the needle?","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Well, that's a weird thing to say..","the-dealership",165
"RICK","I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","This is nice. What kind of car is this?","the-dealership",165
"CABBIE","Caprice Classic.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","(To Jerry) You couldn't just give him one high-five?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","And where does it end? Then, everyone's doin' it. It's like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, ""Don't go there."" - Someone's gotta take a","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(Munching on a hamburger) This Arby's is good.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","So, George, I still don't understand - how was that a setup?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","And who were you tryin' to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","(In the spotlight) I don't know. All of em. They're all crooks! Besides, I couldn't get all different candy bars, anyway.","the-dealership",165
"GEORGE","What was that?","the-dealership",165
"JERRY","I think there's a mental hospital near here.","the-dealership",165
"ELAINE","Very near.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Whew! Well, I think we stopped.","the-dealership",165
"RICK","You - you can probably let go of my hand now.","the-dealership",165
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, I'll think about it..","the-dealership",165
"RICK","Do you have my card?","the-dealership",165
"THE END"," THE END","the-dealership",165
"WAITRESS","Careful, this plate is extremely hot.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Thank you. Ow!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"WAITRESS","I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","It's my winter coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","A fur?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Is there a problem?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","A seemingly infinite supply.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Ow! Careful, it's hot.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Ow!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","So, Puddy wear's a man fur?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","We never dated in winter.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Cheapness is not a sense.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","You got any pliers?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Hilarious.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Why?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","To prevent an ambush.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","But then anyone can just look in and see you.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMERT","Mmm... Nice wallet.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Wallet.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","That's a five.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Eh, what are you doing?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Like what?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Newman? He did this, too?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, yeah.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","I deal with him.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Except the store's in Delaware.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I'll have 'em overnight it.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Why?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I need everything in there.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Irish money?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I might go there.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Who is it?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","It's Newman.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","I can't believe I'm being evicted.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","What? What are you talking about?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","No. No, he can't do that.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","George, I am loving this no wallet thing.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","A man carries a wallet.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Hey, Jerry.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Love to.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Thanks. Jerry...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Music?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","But I could do that and the music.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I was ready to get jiggy with it.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Hey.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","So, George... did you get the chair?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","No, I don't have it yet.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","So, we're givin' him nothing?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","No, I brought a picture of the chair.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Did you at least get him a card?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I thought we'd all sign the picture.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Elaine...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Hey, Joe Mayo.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","I need you to be in charge of coats.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Oh, fantastic.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Sure thing, Joe Mayo.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","Nice.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Why are we in Jerry's apartment?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","OK, on your word he can stay.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All right.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, you won't regret it.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","What's wrong?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Elaine, thanks for coming.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Good working with you.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","All right, let's hit the bricks.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","What?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JOE MAYO","Hey, I got a coat just like this!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Oh. Uhhh...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","So Joe Mayo had the same coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","And you threw it out the window?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Mm-hmm.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","God, you're like a rock star.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Because you threw it out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","But you did actually throw his coat out the window.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","But that's you.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Look at you. You're on a slant.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Here, just give me a couple of napkins.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","There, there I'm fine.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What was that?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I think I had some hard candy in there.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Ahhh. How does this thing work?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Ahhhhh...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"DELIVERY MAN","Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Ahhhhh...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","Ready to go?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","You don't go that often?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Compact, lipstick, all this?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","And can you help to carry my keys?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What are you, a medieval dungeon master?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","And a tin of altoids.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Ow! Sharp key.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Well, there's very little sleeping going on.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, why didn't you tell me about this?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Hey, what is that up that tree?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","The Pacific Northwest.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Not more of that crap from the Titanic?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","No. No. It's a small men's carryall.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I'm not carrying a purse.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","It's not a purse. It's European.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Oh.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Yeah?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","It's in... transit.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Did he get it?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","No.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Allllll right!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What is that noise?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","What are you talking about?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What was that pop sound?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, I had some hard candy in there.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Come in, come in.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","This isn't about my opening your mail?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","What?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Sorry. Climbers, keepers.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","You are?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Ha ha ha ha.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Uh, don't worry, he's cool.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Cool?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","All right, we're done here.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"NEWMAN","For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERIL","Nice carryall.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","It's European.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","Do you still have my lipstick?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","My job was to keep you away from the music.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","What, he doesn't like my taste in music?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KERI","Guess not.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hey, Silvio!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Look at this.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Huh?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Relax, Silvio.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","No, that's it. You're both out of the building!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","A man's?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","What kind of a man would wear fur?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, lots of 'em.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Would you?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","No.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Then who?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","What about Jerry?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Jerry?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Yeah, something like that.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I have to do what?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I'm not wearing the fur.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Is that right?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Newman, too?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","That's my walkman!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","And you'll get it back.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","All right.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","George, did you get that chair yet?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Excuse me?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","No, you don't have to buy anything.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Your good friend is morbidly obese.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","It's not a purse. It's European!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","All right.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","There you go.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","How do I look?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Ahh....","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"GEORGE","My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","That is your coat?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","It sure is.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","That's true.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Jerry, you forgot your purse.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Oh, thanks.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Maybe this isn't my coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","All right, you're not fancy!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","No, that's not your coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","It's Joe Mayo's coat.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"SILVIO","Who's Joe Mayo?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"KRAMER","That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"COP","Your what?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","The...black, leather...thing with a strap.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"COP","You mean a purse?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","He should have had a reverse peephole.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"PUDDY","Hey, Babe.","the-reverse-peephole",166
"JERRY","Hello? Hello?","the-reverse-peephole",166
"ELAINE","What is that?","the-reverse-peephole",166

"GLENN","I think you're very beautiful.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks. I think it might be over.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","So, what's this guy about?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked. I'll be he's in a relationship.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity. Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Which one is he?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Green suit, power ring.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I don't care for jewellery on men.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Hey. It happened again. Another robbery in the building.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","So you bought a cooler?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","And... what would those be?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations. My Tony, my... military discharge.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You were in the Army?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Literally.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","'Literally'? What's that supposed to mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","No, go ahead.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Oh, come on!","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Well, that's classified.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Kramer?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","No, the Green Lantern.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","OK!","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","You peeked!","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","This is your hiding place?!","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","It was under a spoon!","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","No, George, we're not.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","But I proved it!","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like launching","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","Well, I might ask you the same thing.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Oh, that is so sweet.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Who is it?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","You didn't hear me buzzing?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Oh, I guess it's broken.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Throw down your key.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I'll catch it!","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You'll chicken out at the last second.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Yeah, you're right.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","All right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","All right.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Huh?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","I used to be able to have a huge meal, go right to sleep. But I can't","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Nodding off!","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","What are you doing with her?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Security issue!","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","So, he's definitely married, huh?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Yeah...","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Boy, I would've loved to have been there when you told him off.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Hmm...","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Oh, come on!","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!","the-strong-box",168
"COAT POCKET","I believe this belongs to you.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Heyyyy!","the-strong-box",168
"GRANOLA BAR","Where did you get that?","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","I bought it.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","What?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","But, I live here. I ran out to get some birdseed, and-and I forgot my","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Sounds like a scam.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Great, you're lonely and miserable again.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Feels right.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Is that guy still there?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Don't look at him.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Want a bite?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","No, I don't.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship,","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Why does it only seem like I'm the only one working at this breakup?","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","All right.","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot.","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","Ah, should I light a fire?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Oh, that sounds romantic.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Oh, sure.","the-strong-box",168
"LADY","Where's Glenn?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm","the-strong-box",168
"LADY","Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","This is his home?","the-strong-box",168
"LADY","Yes.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","So, he's...","the-strong-box",168
"LADY","Poor.","the-strong-box",168
"IN WITH HIM","So you do live here.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","Yeah.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","Yeah.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","Yeah.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","So I guess I'll see--","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, with the","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","How can I end it over money? I feel bad.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Good. How did you handle that?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Hey, where have you been?","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Who's this, Blue Arrow?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Green Lantern.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","We found out his super power was lack of money.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","All right.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","He's invulnerable to creditors.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","We get it.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Thank you.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.","the-strong-box",168
"VACANT","She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Could you move over there?","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Really? How come you never pursued her before?","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Hey.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","There's a giant parrot in the hallway.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","It's Phil's.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Who?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","What'd ya tell him that for?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","He let you?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","I was in Maine for a couple days.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Well... here we are.","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Ho ho!","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","I want to build something with you, George.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Oh, not more building.","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","And I won't take no for an answer.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","No?","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","No.","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","It's a surprise.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","What are you doing? What is that?","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","It's a bag of donuts.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","It's garbage.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Make it three hundred.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Phil... hi. I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. But your","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","And?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","That's my wife.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","This isn't going well.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Where are you goin'? Help me look.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Which is with who?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","I can't go until I find my cufflinks.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Hey, what's going on?","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","Fredo is dead.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","No! my bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.","the-strong-box",168
"PHIL","Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","But I, I didn't--","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a bird?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Just get the key and let's get out here.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","You know, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Kramer!?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","What?","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You killed Fredo!","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've eaten that key.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","You just answered your own question.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Oh, no.","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","What?","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","You told me to meet you here for lunch.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","So can we.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","What? So, this is still not over?","the-strong-box",168
"MAURA","No.","the-strong-box",168
"GEORGE","You?","the-strong-box",168
"LORETTA","No.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Who is this?","the-strong-box",168
"ALLISON","His wife.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","You're poor and married?","the-strong-box",168
"GLENN","Looks like it.","the-strong-box",168
"ALLISON","Who the hell are you?","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","I guess I'm Lois Loan.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Hey, neighbor.","the-strong-box",168
"ELAINE","Give me forty, you'll never see me again.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess I forgot to lock it.","the-strong-box",168
"JERRY","You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for something?","the-strong-box",168
"KRAMER","Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? Really one for the books.","the-strong-box",168
"THE END"," THE END","the-strong-box",168

"GEORGE","Should we be talkin' about this?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","I think it's OK.","the-wizard",169
"GEORGE","No, it isn't.","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","Why not?","the-wizard",169
"GEORGE","Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","If he's black.","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","Is he black?","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","Does it matter?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","Oh, so you need to know?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.","the-wizard",169

"DARRYL","What are you talking about?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","We are. Because you're Hispanic.","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","I am?","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","Aren't you?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","No. Why would you think that?","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","That's because I thought you were black.","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","I don't think we should be talking about this.","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","So, what are you?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","I'm white.","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","So, we're just a couple of white people?","the-wizard",169
"ELAINE","I guess.","the-wizard",169
"DARRYL","Oh.","the-wizard",169

"OLD MAN","It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.","the-wizard",169
"MORTY","This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!","the-wizard",169
"MORTY","Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.","the-wizard",169
"MORTY","You didn't have a deal?","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","No deal. Not hot.","the-wizard",169
"OLD MAN","Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished.","the-wizard",169
"KRAMER","What?","the-wizard",169
"OLD MAN","Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","Dad, I'm sorry.","the-wizard",169
"MORTY","You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip","the-wizard",169
"JERRY","It does other things!","the-wizard",169
"GEORGE","Almost there.","the-wizard",169
"MR. ROSS","Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?","the-wizard",169

"GEORGE","Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why","the-wizard",169
"MRS. ROSS","We don't like you, George.","the-wizard",169
"MR. ROSS","And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.","the-wizard",169

"GEORGE","Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend","the-burning",170
"KRUGER","Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","And then?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I can't just leave.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","That's the way they do it in Vegas.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","You never played Vegas.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","I hear things.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Yes, he is lazy.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Yes, he is dumb.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Dumb and lazy, I understand.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Tell you how you could check.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","How?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The","the-burning",170
"JERRY","No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio","the-burning",170

"MAN","Sure.","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","Okay, what do you got?","the-burning",170
"MAN","The surgeon left a sponge inside me.","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","Good luck with that.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","What did you do the rest of the day?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Hello boys.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","I did.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","And the Christian rock?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","I thought so.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me"".","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's","the-burning",170

"KRAMER","That's what they gave me.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","They? The Government?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","What was that?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.","the-burning",170

"JERRY","Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","That was very real.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?","the-burning",170

"PUDDY","I'm not the one going to hell.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","No, she looks completely normal.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor","the-burning",170
"JERRY","You think she's got toes for thumbs?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too","the-burning",170
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Hands a little smelly?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Why do I seek your counsel?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Well I'm going to hell.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","That seems about right.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","According to Puddy.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","I'm not in the mood.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","What do you care? You don't believe in hell.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","I know, but he does.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Well, relationships are very important to me.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","And a slice of devil's food","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Hey. Where is everyone?","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I am?","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Okay.","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair)","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","And?","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","All me.","the-burning",170

"SOPHIE","I move my knight... here. Check.","the-burning",170

"JERRY","Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","A scar?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","A tractor.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe","the-burning",170
"JERRY","She doesn't have toe thumbs.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","I'm not too worried about it.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","Alright, alright I'm going.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Never.","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","C'mon, get it.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Well if you want it, you get it.","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","Sorry, thou shalt not steal.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Oh, but it's ok for me?","the-burning",170

"ELAINE","Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","Nah.","the-burning",170

"ELAINE","David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","Gonna be rough.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Uh, you should be trying to save me!","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Yeah, that's right!","the-burning",170
"MICKEY","Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for","the-burning",170
"DR. WEXLER","Mr. Kramer? You're up.","the-burning",170
"MICKEY","Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?","the-burning",170

"MICKEY","Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps","the-burning",170
"FATHER CURTIS","Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't","the-burning",170
"ELAINE AND PUDDY","Yeah, that's right.","the-burning",170
"FATHER CURTIS","Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.","the-burning",170
"FATHER CURTIS","You aren't?","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","No.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","We're just, you know, having a good time.","the-burning",170
"FATHER CURTIS","Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","No way, this is bogus, man!","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Well, thank you father.","the-burning",170
"FATHER CURTIS","Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng","the-burning",170
"PUDDY","I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.","the-burning",170
"ELAINE","Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.","the-burning",170
"SOPHIE","You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about.","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.","the-burning",170
"SOPHIE","How could you know?","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","...I didn't say that, no.","the-burning",170
"MICKEY","You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Hey, hey! I'm with someone.","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","Oh. Hello.","the-burning",170
"SOPHIE","No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","You know? She's right.","the-burning",170
"SOPHIE","Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a","the-burning",170
"JERRY","You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor","the-burning",170
"KRAMER","You can't get it from that.","the-burning",170
"SOPHIE","But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor","the-burning",170
"JERRY","Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh?","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","Thank you George, you've been great. That's","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","It's K-uger!","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","No! No!","the-burning",170
"MR. KRUGER","Goodnight everybody!","the-burning",170
"THE END"," THE END","the-burning",170
"GEORGE","I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) You better hurry.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","I'm gonna hit the head.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Oh? Who's Leo?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Uncle Leo.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Did I just see that?!","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?","the-bookstore",171
"WALTER","(Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Maybe.. All over your face!","the-bookstore",171
"WAITER","If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music","the-bookstore",171
"ZACH","Hi, I'm Zach.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Acting innocent) I'm all set.","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Sleeping in the caragain?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Cocktail flu.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","You went home with him?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Confused) What's your position?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","I am an associate.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Hey, me too.","the-bookstore",171
"WAITRESS","Yeah, me too.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Yes, it can.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","So, who's gonna pull this thing?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","Yeah, but I though-","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","Can't we worry about them later?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Jerry, hello! (Sits down)","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Why didn't ya say hello?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Because you were too busy stealing a book.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Oh, they don't care. We all do it.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Who, criminals?","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Senior citizens. No big deal.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","You could get arrested.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Pleading) Leo..","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?","the-bookstore",171
"WALTER","Well..","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","""Well""? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..","the-bookstore",171
"WALTER","(Pointing at the closed door) Isn't that Zach?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Yeah.","the-bookstore",171
"WALTER","Aren't you upset?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated,","the-bookstore",171
"HOMELESS MAN","The government!","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","Alright, who's first?","the-bookstore",171
"KRMAER","Hey.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","Name, please.","the-bookstore",171
"HOMELESS MAN","Rusty.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Hey, what's he doin'?","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","I think he stealing our rickshaw!","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Well, then, he's out!","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.","the-bookstore",171
"CASHIER","(Puts the book's code into the computer) I'm sorry, we can't take this book back.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Why not?","the-bookstore",171
"CASHIER","It's been flagged.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Confused) Flagged?","the-bookstore",171
"CASHIER","It's been in the bathroom.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","It says that on the computer?","the-bookstore",171
"CASHIER","Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with","the-bookstore",171
"GUARD","Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..","the-bookstore",171
"GAURD","(Into his walkie-talkie) We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?","the-bookstore",171
"GUARD","Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. (The Guard rushes tward Uncle Leo) Swarm! Swarm!","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!","the-bookstore",171
"GUARD","You're under arrest.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Jerry, you ratted me out?!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","Hello.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.","the-bookstore",171
"HELEN","Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.","the-bookstore",171
"MORTY","She's got priors.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?","the-bookstore",171
"HELEN","It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.","the-bookstore",171
"MORTY","Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Confused) What does that mean?","the-bookstore",171
"HELEN","Nobody pays for everyting.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!","the-bookstore",171
"MORTY","Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Mom, you too?","the-bookstore",171
"HELEN","Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Alright, I'll talk to you later.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","To the Idiotmobile!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Butting in) Tina Turner?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Accepting) Alright.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Stern on George) Not underpants.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.","the-bookstore",171

"LEO","(Bitter) Jerry.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.","the-bookstore",171
"LEO","(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Nothing.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","How much do you want for it?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Confused) What is wrong with this book?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Simmer!","the-bookstore",171

"GEORGE","(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","I don't read in the bathroom.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Well, aren't you something?","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","(Confused) Love newton?","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-","the-bookstore",171
"PETERMAN","(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst.","the-bookstore",171

"ELAINE","Eat your soup!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","You're not feeding him, are you?","the-bookstore",171
"ELAINE","Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the","the-bookstore",171

"JERRY","I want everyone out!","the-bookstore",171

"KRAMER","(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","Uh..","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","What?","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Yes, that's true.","the-bookstore",171
"NEWMAN","So, which one of us is gonna pull?","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot,","the-bookstore",171

"REBECCA","What's the value of the book?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.","the-bookstore",171

"GEORGE","(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.","the-bookstore",171
"REBECCA","It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?","the-bookstore",171
"REBECCA","Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!","the-bookstore",171

"NEWMAN","Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.","the-bookstore",171
"KRAMER","(Stretching) Oh..","the-bookstore",171

"NEWMAN","Waaaaahhhh!","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","George? What are you doin' here?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","I can't sell the book. It's been marked.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","I'm goin' in!","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","Did you want to speak with the manager?","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","So it could be anyone?","the-bookstore",171
"MANAGER","I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.","the-bookstore",171
"JERRY","That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!","the-bookstore",171
"GEORGE","No! Jerry!","the-bookstore",171

"JERRY","What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Why aren't you there now?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Your old high school hangout? Why?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","They're closing. We're going for one last slice.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Where did you get this?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","They want to know why they never see you.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","I'm gonna eat that later.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","So they just gave you this?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","How come I haven't read about this?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Really? What're the other titles?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Son of dad?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Mario's Pizza.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?","the-frogger",172
"MARIO","No.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","We used to come in every day.","the-frogger",172
"MARIO","So where ya been? We're tanking here.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.","the-frogger",172
"MARIO","Oh, thanks. That'll save us.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","All right, make it the large sodas.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!","the-frogger",172
"BOY","Thanks a lot.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Ah, beat it, punk.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","I remember that night.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...","the-frogger",172
"MARIO","Here's your pizza pea brains.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","I think I remember why we stopped coming here.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","What is this?","the-frogger",172
"MALE WORKER","You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake.","the-frogger",172
"FEMALE WORKER","It's carrot. It's good for you.","the-frogger",172
"WORKERS","Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?","the-frogger",172
"MALE WORKER","I think it's nice.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!","the-frogger",172
"WORKER","Get well, get well soon--","the-frogger",172
"MALE WORKER","It's not happening.","the-frogger",172
"BECKY","Can we still it eat?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--","the-frogger",172
"LISI","End under water?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--","the-frogger",172
"LISI","So much more violent.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Not as long.","the-frogger",172
"LISI","Well, I should probably--","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Get going.","the-frogger",172
"LISI","Yeah.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--","the-frogger",172
"LISI","Eight tomorrow?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Actually, that's--","the-frogger",172
"LISI","What you were thinking.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Right.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","What?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Well, more bad news Jerry.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Not as many as there used to be.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Another friend?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Well, is he good, Kramer?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Oh, he's the best...and the worst.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Slippery Pete?","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Come on.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Hello?","the-frogger",172
"INTERCUT"," INTERCUT","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","So how's it going with my friend?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","What is that?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","So join in.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","All right.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Hey, wh-what--","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Anybody here? Peterboy?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Ooh, it's a cake walk.","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Mr. Peterman, um--","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","No, sir, I can't.","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well Lisi, that was another-","the-frogger",172
"LISI","Lovely evening.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--","the-frogger",172
"LISI","Go for a hansom cab ride?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?","the-frogger",172
"LISI","84th street, right off Riverside Park.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Riverside Park.","the-frogger",172
"LISI","I thought we were going--","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Back to my place. That's right.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","So you slept with her?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","And you automatically sleep with her?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Finished your thought.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Guess what I ate.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","An ostrich burger.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","How'd it taste?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","A little stale.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.","the-frogger",172
"EALINE","What is going on with you two?","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","What's that?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","4:00 sugar fix.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well, I'm calling this off right now.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Just a little off the side...","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Well, no point in wasting $1,200.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?","the-frogger",172

"KRAMER","Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.","the-frogger",172
"SLIPPERY PETE","It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","You weren't even married yet.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.","the-frogger",172

"GEORGE","No. I--I paid for it.","the-frogger",172
"SLIPPERY PETE","I thought we were stealing it.","the-frogger",172
"KRAMER","Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","We're not stealing it.","the-frogger",172
"SHLOMO","I definitely thought we're stealing it.","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?","the-frogger",172
"SLIPPERY PETE","Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?","the-frogger",172

"JERRY","By yourself?","the-frogger",172
"GEORGE","Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.","the-frogger",172
"SHLOMO","He looks like a Frog.","the-frogger",172
"SLIPPERY PETE","So do you.","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Game over.","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.","the-frogger",172
"EALINE","Ohh...","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.","the-frogger",172
"EALINE","Mr. Peterman, I, uh...","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Um...as far as I know.","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?","the-frogger",172
"ELAINE","Uh, I guess I hadn't--","the-frogger",172
"PETERMAN","Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.","the-frogger",172
"THE END"," THE END","the-frogger",172
"JERRY","Cup of tea with lemon.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","What happened to your voice?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","You mean like...Liza!","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","But I was thinking...T-bone.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","There's no G-bone.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","There's a g-spot.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","That's a myth.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Why did they hire you for a rodeo?","the-maid",173

"ELAINE","Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Oh, I had that comin' to me.","the-maid",173

"JERRY","What?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Notice what? She's not really even a maid.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","You have a girlfriend?","the-maid",173

"KRAMER","I don't know.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","What? What is that?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","At work?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","No. At your apartment.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","I don't have a fax machine.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Here we go.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","And a dead bolt.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Then maybe you have a fax machine.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","You just blew my mind.","the-maid",173

"CINDY","Hi, Elaine.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","What? A health plan?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I was going to say, ""Being a good host.""","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh-ho-ho. Oh.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","So you consider this a relationship?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Yes, I do.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh. Have you been out?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Yes, we have.","the-maid",173

"ELAINE","Cleaning supplies?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","And gum.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Which ones?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.","the-maid",173

"ELAINE","You can pick 'em up right now.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Ah!","the-maid",173

"PHONE MAN","All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Ahem. 646? What is this?","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","That's your new area code.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","I thought 646 was just for new numbers.","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","This is a new number.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","I could've killed you, and no one would've known.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Kramer, you're still on the phone?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?","the-maid",173

"MAN","Do I have to dial a one first?","the-maid",173
"MAN","I'm really kinda seein' somebody.","the-maid",173

"KRAMER","No, no, no. I looked.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Thanks, buddy.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Where you goin'?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Oh.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","Hi, Kramer.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","Thanks, Jerry. Bye.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Well, what's the matter?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","What did I just pay for?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Uh-oh. You're a john.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Koko?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Koko.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--","the-maid",173
"JERRY","No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","How much you pay this maid?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","40.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I don't know what this is.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Ooh.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Well, now I can't see Jerry.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I look about the same.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","What?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I was talking to him.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","What?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Never mind.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Come on. What'd he say?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Never mind.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Jerry, come on. What'd you say?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","What?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Come on. Where'd you go?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Go back.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Eh! Come on. What did you say?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I said, never mind.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I hate the counter.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Hey.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Hey.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","I hate the counter.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Who's that?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Oh, she didn't mind?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","No. She died.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Hey, that's great.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","What happened to Mrs. Krantz?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Elaine got a new number because she died.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Newman died?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","What did he say?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Some new kind of pie.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","I'll try a piece.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","All right, who's down there?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Hey, there's a booth.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Hey, Elaine.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh, hi.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Did you hear about Newman?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","What?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Hey.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Oh, yeah.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Double zero?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah.""","the-maid",173
"CINDY","Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Really? Coco?","the-maid",173
"CINDY","Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Say good-bye to Koko.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Good-bye, Koko.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!","the-maid",173
"CINDY","What was that?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I didn't hear anything.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","No. My money.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","For what?","the-maid",173
"CINDY","For my maid services. You booked me for today.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","But you didn't really do any work.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","I made the bed.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","But you took a nap in it.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","So?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","No. That was the maid.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Well, who took the nap?","the-maid",173
"CINDY","The girlfriend.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.","the-maid",173
"CINDY","You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","So is this a breakupquitting?","the-maid",173
"CINDY","Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","Sign here.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Yes! 212.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?","the-maid",173
"PHONE MAN","Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","All right! I am back in the game.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Hello?","the-maid",173
"BOY","Gammy!","the-maid",173

"BOY","Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Oh...nuts.","the-maid",173
"BOY","Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","Miss.","the-maid",173

"JERRY","Well, what happened?","the-maid",173
"KRAMER","I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home,","the-maid",173

"MAN","You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?","the-maid",173
"JERRY","What?","the-maid",173
"MAN","Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.","the-maid",173
"JERRY","I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.","the-maid",173
"MAN","Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.","the-maid",173
"ELAINE","Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think","the-maid",173

"KRUGER","Hey, Koko, Who's this?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Yes?","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","Ok, good enough for me, Koko.","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","Ahem. Now, what's your name?","the-maid",173
"COCO","My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Coco?","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Well, it was a hell of a ride.","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?","the-maid",173
"COCO","When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ--","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.","the-maid",173
"COCO","What did you say about my Gammy?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Forget Gammy.","the-maid",173
"KRUGER","Who's Gammy?","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","There's no Gammy.","the-maid",173

"THE END"," THE END","the-maid",173
"GEORGE","Man, I'm starving.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Those nachos are killing me.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","I thought you were hungry.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","It's complicated.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Keep your shirt on. I got it.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Watch out for that maroon Golf.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Oh, boy.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Oh, no, I couldn't do that.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Oh, all right.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Yeah.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah. What's that called?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","How was it?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!""","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Heh.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","The place went nuts.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Why are we slowing down?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","What is that music?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","What's with all these flags?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Oh, no.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE AND JERRY","It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"RADIO","And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Just inch over. You worm your way.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"GEORGE","My hand is out.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","You sure you want his face?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"GEORGE","Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LASER GUY","The laser's not funny. I'm funny.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LASER GUY","Uh-huh.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","This traffic's a killer, ain't it?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Walk away?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Isn't there a deductible?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","All right, what is your deductible?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Yes, because they've already deducted it.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","From what?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","We're not leaving the car!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Absolutely not. He sped up.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"RADIO","Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I'm ready to talk.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","That's gotta hurt!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","What's that?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Ok!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","What's that on your forehead?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","It's probably chocolate.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an ""I'm not sorry"" wave.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","What was that?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Elaine?!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Jerry?!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"PUERTO RICAN MAN","Buenos dias, my friend.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Not you! The guy in the Amigo.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"TAXI DRIVER","Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Elaine, he doesn't need-","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","'Cause that's what's gonna happen.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I don't know.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"SALES WOMAN","Did the broker send you over?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"SALES WOMAN","The asking price is $1.5 million.","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"PRIEST","I heard that!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"LAMAR","You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Ho ho!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","What seems to be the problem, officer?","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"SALES WOMAN","Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"SALES WOMAN","Well, it's--","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"BUSINESS MAN","Wanna make out some more?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"ELAINE","Oh, god! Let us out!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","That wasn't a laser pen.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"DELIVERY MAN","No. It's just a pen.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Oh, that's funny","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"DELIVERY MAN","No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Ooh! !Dios mio!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"MAN","Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"BOB","Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"SALES WOMAN","Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"JERRY","The Saab factory?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Jerry, that's in Sweden.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","My car!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","Jerry, the Mets lost.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","I love a parade!","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"GEORGE","How do you suppose they did that?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"KRAMER","Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","Well, what about my car?","the-puerto-rican-day",174

"KRAMER","This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"THE END"," THE END","the-puerto-rican-day",174
"JERRY","It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then our brains will work.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?""","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","I know what you mean.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Do ya?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Same thing!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?","the-finale-part-1",175
"WOMAN","What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?","the-finale-part-1",175
"MAN","It's up to you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"WOMAN","You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Nah - what for?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","To see a movie.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I've been to the movies.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Not this movie.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Did you shower today?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick","the-finale-part-1",175
"WOMAN","All right, we're done. You can have it now.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Oh, very gracious.","the-finale-part-1",175
"MAN","Nice day","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175

"KRAMER","No, thank you. So what are you doing?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Nothing.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Come on, let's go to the beach.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","What are you crazy?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","What? It's a beautiful day.","the-finale-part-1",175

"KRAMER","Yeah, there's something in the air.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What? No good?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Faux pas.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Faux pas?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Big hefty stinking faux pas.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Why?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street.""","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's dismissive.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","It's pompous.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Why don't you think before you do something?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Here's a thought - Bye bye.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Too much?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Hey - hey - hey!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","You're so uptight.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.","the-finale-part-1",175
"PHONE TAPE","Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call? Thanks.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Who's he?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about ""Jerry.""","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Our show, ""Jerry""?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Right.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","When?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Today, like right now.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Right now? ""Jerry""?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","""Jerry""!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","""Jerry""!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","""Jerry""!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Can I go like this?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Sure!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Forget the sports jacket.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I won't feel like a writer.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","You're not a writer.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Right!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Water. Need some water! Water here!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Don't blow this.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I will not blow this.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","He might not want nothing.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Something, nothing, I could care less.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","He might want a show about anything and everything.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","All right.","the-finale-part-1",175
"RECEPTIONIST","Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Magic time.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"RECEPTIONIST","Mr. Kimbrough.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","Hey, Jerry, good to see you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Hey, hey, hey!","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","How you been?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Good, good. You remember George.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","George, good to see you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Hello Stu.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","You remember Jay Crespi.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","This is James Kimbrough.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Kimbrough.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Don't spell.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","That's right.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's a talent I have.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Shut up, George.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Can I get you anything?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","What do we have in the fruit department?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Oy.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","Pineapple.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Been there, done that.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Water coolers?","the-finale-part-1",175
"CRESPI","We call it a water-cooler show.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than ""coffee machine show.""","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he developed five years ago.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","I have always loved it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CRESPI","He totally flipped out.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","He's a little off the wall.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CRESPI","Oh yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STU","Kramer.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Definitely.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KIMBROUGH","Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Or we could get them together. Woo!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Yeah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Hi. Elaine, it's me.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Jerry, I'm on the other line.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","That's the emergency?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Did you hear what I said?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","I was on the other line talking to Jill.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","You said it was an emergency.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.","the-finale-part-1",175
"HELEN","Congratulations, they're doing the show.","the-finale-part-1",175
"MORTY","They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.","the-finale-part-1",175
"HELEN","She's not six-six.","the-finale-part-1",175
"MORTY","Jerry, you ever watch that?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah, it's pretty good.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","They picked up the show?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I'm moving to California.","the-finale-part-1",175
"FRANK","Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","The NBC guy liked it?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Of course he liked it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","He told you he liked it?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","Well, what are you doing?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I'm writing.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","You know how to write?","the-finale-part-1",175
"FRANK","Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Ma?!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?","the-finale-part-1",175
"FRANK","Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ESTELLE","Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Oh hey!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Hey - how was the beach?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","You're moving to California?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah, only for a while.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","No, I'll be back.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Fling!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","So we can go anywhere we want?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Anywhere.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Why are they doing this?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","This is all very exciting.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","So? Where are we going?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","I say Japan.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Why Japan?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Oh - I got it - how about Russia?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Russia, it's so bleak.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","It's not bleak - it's springtime.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","It's still bleak.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","You can't be bleak in spring.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","You can be bleak in spring.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","If you're bleak, you're bleak.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What about Switzerland?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's a bit hilly - no?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","You're not going to do any walking.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","What if I want to walk around a little?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","What if I'm at the bottom?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","All right! You know what, just forget it!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","I'll go to Paris.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Me too.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Oh yeah - oui oui.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GROUP","Yeah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","Hello, Jerry.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Hello, Newman. What gives?","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah, that's right.","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Really.","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","That's a shame.","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","Take me! Take me!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!","the-finale-part-1",175
"NEWMAN","All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","Ah, Jerry?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","All set. We'll just grab the bags.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Just keeps on getting better and better.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Not bad.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Wow!","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","The only way to fly.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","This is it?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","You're complaining about a private jet?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","You're not writing any letters!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Will you turn around?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Why?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","It's effeminate to sit like this?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","How is this effeminate?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","I don't know - it just is.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Kramer, what are you doing?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Still got water in your ear?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Kramer!","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","Hey, get the hell out of here!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What is that?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Oh my God!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What is that noise? What is that noise?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Kramer, what the hell did you do?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","I lost my balance.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Oh my God!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What's going on?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Kramer!","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","It was an accident.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I told you to stop with the hopping.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","There's something I have to tell you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","What? What is it?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I cheated in the contest.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","The contest - I cheated.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Why?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Great - I won.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","No no - me first.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Alright.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Jerry, I've always loved ..u..","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Hey - What's going on?","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","We're straightening out!","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","We're straightening out?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","We're straightening out!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","We're straightening out!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GROUP","Yeah!","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Where are we?","the-finale-part-1",175
"CAPTAIN","Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Okay.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Okay.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","We'll see you later.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Alright, I'll feel him out.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.","the-finale-part-1",175
"STRANGER","Nice day.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Another one?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ROBBER","Alright fatso, out of the car.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","I want to capture this.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ROBBER","Come on! Gimme your wallet.","the-finale-part-1",175
"VICTIM","Don't shoot.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Well, there goes the money for the lipo.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ROBBER","I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.","the-finale-part-1",175
"NBC."," NBC.","the-finale-part-1",175
"VICTIM","Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Forget it.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.","the-finale-part-1",175
"OFFICER","All right, hold it right there.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"OFFICER","You're under arrest.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Under arrest? What for?","the-finale-part-1",175
"OFFICER","Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What? No, no - we didn't do anything.","the-finale-part-1",175
"OFFICER","That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.George: I never heard of that.","the-finale-part-1",175
"OFFICER","It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Why would we want to help somebody?","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","I know.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.","the-finale-part-1",175
"DEPUTY","Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.","the-finale-part-1",175
"JERRY","Oh, yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","Oh, yeah.","the-finale-part-1",175
"DEPUTY","You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.","the-finale-part-1",175
"DEPUTY","Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.","the-finale-part-1",175
"ELAINE","What?","the-finale-part-1",175
"GEORGE","Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.","the-finale-part-1",175
"DEPUTY","California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CHILES","Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.","the-finale-part-1",175
"SECRETARY","Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.","the-finale-part-1",175
"CHILES","You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.","the-finale-part-1",175
"PROSECUTOR","So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?","the-finale-part-1",175
"D.A. HOYT","Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be  character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.","the-finale-part-1",175
"THE END"," THE END","the-finale-part-1",175
"KRAMER","Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","I guess we could've called for help.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","But then we would have missed the whole thing.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Yeah, he's right.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","I forgot about the video.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Sure - the video.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","What is that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Plane's ready.","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","What's the mood? What's going on tonight?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group.""","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","Anything else, Jane?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated,","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HELEN","I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.","the-finale-part-2",176
"MORTY","What's all that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HELEN","Cereal.","the-finale-part-2",176
"MORTY","You're packing cereal?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HELEN","I'm bringing it for Jerry.","the-finale-part-2",176
"MORTY","You got enough here for a life sentence.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HELEN","He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.","the-finale-part-2",176
"MORTY","So bring a snack-pack.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","You were the one who smothered him.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","I did not smother him.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","I had to make a living!","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","I bet.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Good morning.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Good morning, Jackie.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Good morning.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","It makes me look older.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Do you think it's funny?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","No.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","How do I look, Jackie?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Thank you, Jackie.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","How bout me, Jackie?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Here.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","This one?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","That's right.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Do I have to?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Jackie says put it on, Jerry.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Vanda who?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Jerry, did you hear that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Yeah.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","I think that's a good sign.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","We are, Your Honor.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Mr. Hoyt.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Mr. Chiles.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","Call Matt Vogel.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So they were just standing there?","the-finale-part-2",176
"VOLEG","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Did one of them have a video camera?","the-finale-part-2",176
"VOGEL","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.","the-finale-part-2",176
"A."," A.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Proceed.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VICTIM","Don't shoot.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Well, there goes the money for the lipo.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So they just stood there and did nothing?","the-finale-part-2",176
"VICTIM","Yeah, nothing. Nothing!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","No further questions.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Call Mabel Choate to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","Call Mabel Choate.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","What did he want?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","My marble rye.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Your marble rye?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And then you left the bakery.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","That's right.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","Oh no.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Gimme that rye.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","Stop it.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","I want that rye lady.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHOATE","Help - someone help.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Shut up, you old bag!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","No further questions.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","I call Marla Penny to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","Call Marla Penny.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","The virgin!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And what was your connection to the defendants?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","It's rather difficult to talk about.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","It's alright. Take your time.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","Well, I became aware of a -","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","A what?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","A, uh -","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Yes?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","A contest.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Contest?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","What was the nature of the contest?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","Oh please, I can't.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","It's okay.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","The four of them made a wager to see if they could -","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Yes?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PETERMAN","For the love of God!","the-finale-part-2",176
"PENNY","It was horrible, horrible!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Call Donald Sanger to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Who the hell is that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"MR. SANGER","Come on Donald, you're doing fine.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","The Bubble Boy!","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Bubble Boy?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","That's right, the Bubble Boy.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","What's a Bubble Boy?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","He's a boy who lives in a bubble.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","What the hell are all you looking at?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","That's a joke - the Moors.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Sorry, the card says Moops.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","It's Moops.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","Moors!","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Moops!","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Help! Someone!","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","There's no Moops, you idiot.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SUSAN","Stop it! Let go of him!","the-finale-part-2",176
"MRS. SANGER","Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","It was Moops.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BUBBLE BOY","Moors.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?","the-finale-part-2",176
"LADY","That's right.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?","the-finale-part-2",176
"LADY","That's right.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WILCOX","Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WILCOX","I would describe it as restrained jubilation.","the-finale-part-2",176
"MR. ROSS","Murderer!","the-finale-part-2",176
"MRS. ROSS","He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Order in this court!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Call Sidra Holland to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Yes, that's true.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Why would she do something like that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","State your name.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","Bookman, Joe Bookman.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And what's your occupation?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","I'm a library cop.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","What does a library cop do?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","We chase down library delinquents.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Anyone in this room ever delinquent?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","How long was his book overdue?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","What do you call them?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BOOKMAN","Criminals.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.","the-finale-part-2",176
"WOMAN","Yes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And then what happened?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WOMAN","Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Fire! Get out of the way!","the-finale-part-2",176
"GUARD","At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GUARD","I don't know.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here!","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Sit down, Mr. Chiles.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Alright, Detective, then what happened?","the-finale-part-2",176
"DETECTIVE","We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PRO","You just cost me some money.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.","the-finale-part-2",176
"POLICE","Police officers - freeze right there!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Excuse me?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","Call George Steinbrenner.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?","the-finale-part-2",176
"STEINBRENNER","Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.","the-finale-part-2",176
"STEINBRENNER","He had one little problem though.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","What was that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"STEINBRENNER","He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELEY","Order!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Cock fighting?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WITNESS","Cock fighting.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PHARMACIST","Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of","the-finale-part-2",176
"MAN","She exposed her nipple.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","How did she try to kill you?","the-finale-part-2",176
"PITT","She tried to smother me with a pillow.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Call Yev Kassem to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","Call Yev Kassem.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Who?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","The Soup Nazi!","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","State your name.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","Yev Kassem.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","Could you spell that?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","No! Next question.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","How do you know the defendants?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","They used to come to my restaurant.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Medium turkey chili.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Medium crab bisque.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","I didn't get any bread.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Just forget it. Let it go.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","You want bread?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Yes, please.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","Three dollars!","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","What?","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","No soup for you!","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day,","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","That's my recipe for wild mushroom.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Soup's not all that good anyway.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SOUP NAZI","What did you say?!","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","How did they find Babu?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","I thought he was deported.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BABU","Yes, all the way from Pakistan.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And what's your connection to the defendant?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BABU","I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But nobody came! There were no people.","the-finale-part-2",176
"HOYT","And then what happened?","the-finale-part-2",176
"BABU","Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me, just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice. Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad! Very, very, very bad!","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?","the-finale-part-2",176
"WELLS","That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on,","the-finale-part-2",176
"RIVERA","And so we wait.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","I think so.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","It's not that bright orange one is it?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Sorry to bother you, Judge.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","How did you get in here?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","This is highly irregular.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","What do you mean?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ESTELLE","You know","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JACKIE","We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JACKIE","Hello? Damn. They're ready.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","I've always loved ... United Airlines.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.","the-finale-part-2",176
"BAILIFF","All rise.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?","the-finale-part-2",176
"FOREMAN","We have, Your Honor.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?","the-finale-part-2",176
"FOREMAN","We find the defendants - guilty.","the-finale-part-2",176
"VANDELAY","Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Puddy, don't wait for me.","the-finale-part-2",176
"PUDDY","Alright.","the-finale-part-2",176
"FRANK","We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.","the-finale-part-2",176
"SIDRA","Come on, Jackie. Let's go.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","What?","the-finale-part-2",176
"CHILES","Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Why don't you just blow it out your...","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Sure.","the-finale-part-2",176
"ELAINE","Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","I think that would be a very nice gesture.","the-finale-part-2",176
"KRAMER","I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Really?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","Haven't we had this conversation before?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","You think?","the-finale-part-2",176
"GEORGE","I think we have.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Yeah, maybe we have.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.","the-finale-part-2",176
"GUARD","Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.","the-finale-part-2",176
"JERRY","Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.","the-finale-part-2",176
"THE END"," THE END","the-finale-part-2",176
